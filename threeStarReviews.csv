year,review
2015,"I was having fun with the app and solving the problems until I realized you have to pay for so many things, especially the description to the answer which is frustrating when you don't get why the answer is what it is"
2016,why do I have to pay for solutions? I enjoy learning and keeping my brain active throughout the day. However I like to know that I'm doing my math and such correctly!
2016,"This game does have good puzzles and really challenges you but you don't get to do much without their membership, which is expensive"
2016,"This would be a good app If some of the answers were correct. They say my answers are wrong sometimes when they are clearly correct, please fix this"
2017,"Great app, fun and makes you think. But I can't read some text on the borders"
2017,"The linear algebra module in quantitative finance is lacking a lot of basic explanations.  In discussing the determinant, there is a problem asking what is the determinant of (AB)
 ...  and under the solution it says ...

det(AB) = det(A)det(B)= ((1)(3)-(-2)(1))((2)(1)-(4)(-1)) = (5)(6) = 30

 yet there was no previous explanation in the module of how to calculate the determinant of an individual matrix, i.e. the determinant of A or B. 

Does the person using the app already know how to calculate the determinant?  Will they be able to figure it out by looking at the solution? The way it is written, it is almost like saying that the reader should know.  I feel that is big assumption to make.  What happens when someone is on that module and they get stuck because they don't know?  They may not dig any further and see how to calculate an individual matrix determinant by looking closely at the solution.  Additionally, the next page on the transpose of a matrix repeats in the same fashion, briefly mentioning what a transpose is but having no explanation it how to do it until the vague solution.  

Another issue is the rate at which you guys are completing the modules.  For example, only recently have new modules opened up in the machine learning section, yet it has been sitting there tantalizingly for months.  I have to ask as to the  reason behind this.  Is it financial?  Are you guys stringing people along in the hopes of more profit because of longer subscriptions?  This all quite frustrating because I really feel these oversights are hindering the potential of the Brilliant app.  I like to think that you guys are patiently brainstorming and revising to develop a quality project, but when I look at the quantitative finance section for example, it feels sorely lacking in the depth of material.  It looks like it was put out without good crosschecking and proofing.  

It feels like the developers are being perfectionistic when it comes to releasing new modules.  My recommendation is that you put out what might be partially finished and ask for user input. You have whole community that can help develop these modules - why not tap into that more?"
2017,But shouldn’t be so much money for a membership. I’m sticking to the free problems
2017,Costly
2017,"The problems have little learning content associated with them, and sometimes the answers submitted by the ""crowd"" are wrong. Example: if the solution to a problem involves exponents  squared, the solution doesn't always teach the student the fundamentals of exponent manipulation. BRILLIANT is a good idea, it's execution is lacking, a problem common to the vast majority of apps."
2017,"This app is great from a material standpoint. The coverage is broad, high level, and well conveyed. However at 20 dollars for a month by month subscription it's just too expensive. I wish the app had the option to just let you purchase individual topics."
2017,This app throws you into doing questions without much prep or explanation. You could learn by hitting Solution to the first few problems but by then the section is halfway over. Is that how they want us to learn though? Maybe I’m missing something here about how you’re supposed to use the app.
2017,It’s a very neat app lots of good content and interesting questions and games. That being said I think the price is just impossibly high. I paid for a year because I really enjoy this type of thing and I know that I will use it. I think they should add the option of buying courses individually so it’s not 80 bucks or trial content. Not much flexibility there.
2018,"It is a good app it has helped me with a lot of things. You don’t always show me what your supposed to do for a question... it’s silly. And even when I get have of them wrong I can’t really do it again because I know answer. But, other than that it is a good app."
2018,"One little flaw though in my opinion.
Some of these questions are a little ridiculous or poorly explained to your average person. (I have tested multiple quizzes on my family and friends)... brilliance also records this and makes my intelligent seem a lil low... lol. Result making this app come off a lil completive. When all I wanted to do was have fun learning"
2018,"It does teach you things that are rather helpful, but it only gives you one lesson per category, the rest need to be paid for, which is a ton a crap in my opinion."
2018,"Great problems and pedagogy, the 3 star review is related to the limited functionality of the app. For the iPad version there is a lot of white space below the practice questions, currently I have to switch between the brilliant app and a note app to write down solutions with a stylus. I would be more inclined to use the app if this space could be a “scratch paper” space to solve equations etc."
2018,This app is awesome but it’s hard to learn when your on a low budget.
2018,"“Enjoying your experience with brilliant so far?”
“Yes” answer takes you to the rating. A ‘Brilliant’ way to cheat. You get to rate if you like it."
2018,"It’s a good app but a majority of the features are locked to the standard user.  It would be better to me if you could at least earn some of the levels by flawlessly completing tests or answering a number of hundred questions. If they were able to add this in, even if most of the features were still locked, it would better my experience."
2018,This app is way too entertaining and fun to not be available to everyone for free. You should only have to pay for special features. Not the whole app. $10 is way too much to pay just to unlock ONE level of a pack. Good app just way too overpriced and inconsiderate for us broke people who just enjoy solving problems.
2018,"This looks interesting and I’d be willing to pay $1 or $2 for an individual topic (there are two topics that I’m curious about), if that was an option. But I’m not willing to pay $20/month."
2018,Please scale the application with the new iPad Pros.
2018,"This application is quite informative, fun, and productive. I would recommend that they give more free access."
2018,Good app
2018,"Update: I received the refund. Thanks! I wish the process would be much easier. Modifying the rating from one to three.

Original:
I signed up for a monthly subscription since there is only a few courses I’m interested in. After I finished the course, I set a schedule to cancel the subscription before it renewed. I thought I canceled it because it asked me why I canceled and I selected my reason. I thought that’s it. To my surprise, they charged again. I went in and realized that the subscription is not cancelled because they hide the cancellation button at the very bottom of the page after you selected the reason so I didn’t successfully cancel it Lol. Well, I get it — you want to retain your user. But if a user does not want to use your product anymore, what’s the point of making the cancelation process so difficult. It felt like I was tricked. And customer support refused to refund due to internal policy even though I wasn’t using it at all - check your statistics please. 

So for those of you who only find a few courses interesting, make sure when you cancel, scroll to the bottom of every single page. Otherwise, they will say it’s users fault."
2018,"Love the concept, but it’s locking up regularly"
2018,Good in concept but overpriced
2018,"I’m terrible at math and know nothing about algebra, so I got this in the hopes of learning some algebra from the ground up. The problem is, the exercises immediately jump from really simple to so complex that even the explanations do nothing to help me understand the question. I think it must be geared more towards people who are already good with math and need a brush up. I dabbled into the computer science exercises and they were the same way. 

In short, a little more middle ground is needed for beginners like me."
2018,Ya heard correctly. Fun app but I can’t afford the cost to enjoy the full app.
2018,I understand a lot of work went into this and it has been a lot of fun. It is unfortunate that the premium edition is so expensive. I would recommend it to others but I don’t think they’d want another expensive subscription.
2018,The pay to play for fun!
2018,"update: I received a refund from brilliant today. They can do this in the first place.

I purchased this app for less than 1 month and cancel the subscription. But somehow their system doesn’t reflect. I didn’t realize this until found out they charge again. I contact them immediately, but it took so long for them to reply and they just refuse to refund. Customer service is very poor and won’t help at all."
2019,I tried several of the courses. Most were only available only with a subscription
2019,The app is very cool and I think all schools should use it for homework but however I get in and it says use a free trial.every up does that just why!!!?anyways please fix it so I can take math classes on this thing for my nasa testing.please and thank you!
2019,"The courses are very interesting, as is the learn and answer format, but some practice questions need to be added into courses."
2019,"I thought I was set to enjoy a very productive and challenging app. After multiple attempts to delete and reload this program Things never got any better. It constantly goes into display loops as well as having other flaws.
For the big price tag being posted I’m glad I looked before I leaped."
2019,Its great. I loved it so much! But it’s too expensive. 24usd~100brl... :(
2019,"Very interesting problems. I like them, but they keep pushing you to pay USD 10.00/mo"
2019,"The exercises are engaging, well explained and well thought out. Unfortunately, it’s $120 for a year, which is prohibitive for many."
2019,Product looks great and from the the trail is great. The elitist pricing options not very good. If the pricing changed to be easier to try out for a few months be for buying a $100 membership that would make this product more inviting... It is to hard pony up $25 a month to try it  out when the year membership is just over a hundred and a week is not a long enough trial period... Instead of a week trial they should do a introductory 3 or 6 months membership.
2019,"Two major complaints: No dark mode and font control, second one being a huge problem on smaller sized iPads."
2019,So glad there’s finally an offline mode for modules! Would really like it if offline could be expanded to practice problems as well. Finally getting a dark mode would be great too.
2019,Good product but too expensive.
2019,Great but too expensive! Especially for a student
2019,"I’m finding a lot of formatting issues in the problem descriptions, especially with equations or anything involving numbers. Some are still manageable to the eye, but some are so bad that it makes the whole problem unreadable (ie: « Palindrome Divisibility »). Come on guys..."
2019,It is a good game it’s just hard for kids.
2019,Good job
2019,I think this is an amazing took for education but the price is a bit too high for me to purchase the premium program.
2019,"The app lacks full functionality which I get in the website with safari. Also, sometimes when i minimize the app to use another app, Brilliant closes itself and return to the home, so I need to search the problem I was doing once again."
2019,"I feel like this platform provides an education out of order. Each Course is a series of quizzes. While it does offer content AFTER each question there is no obvious way to review the content you are being tested on before the questions.

The Practice section allows you to navigate to a Wiki section that seemingly covers the material in each course; however, I feel like that is what the course should be?

This format backs each lesson into the content; I feel like the Wiki content should precede the quizzes?

I’d compare the meat of this app to purchasing test questions with an answer key. Sure you can learn the content that way but then why go to class? There is also no easy way to review the material you were just quizzed on without retaking the quiz.

Brilliant is more attuned for reviewing material you have already been exposed to.

I was hoping for more."
2019,90% of the content in this app you have to pay for
2020,I like the app. The app is fun to play. My favorite one is the detective one. You get to try and figure out where things go and try to get answers. I really like it. I bet you would to.
2020,"This is a very good app to keep my mind sharp yes. Yet, I was wondering would you guys every consider making a payment to pay up front for all your courses because I’d be willing to do that to learn majority of these course."
2020,Im using ipad mini and i cannot click login with google
2020,"I think this is a pretty good app, and I was really enjoying it. However, it was awfully disappointing when I found out that for some courses you can only take the introduction unless you pay. 150$ just doesn’t seem worth it. It’s already expensive in USD, but in my country this costs an arm and a leg. I think you could either make more courses free, or just lessen the price of Brilliant Premium."
2020,"Enjoyed the free trial and would have stayed on board monthly, but the 1 yr $150 subscription is a bummer strategy [1] anytime (let people leave if your product stops being useful) but [2] esp. at a time when people gotta be more covid cash careful.  Somebody tell the CEO! Besides that, very fun learning experiences :^)"
2020,"If you want brain puzzles to entertain yourself/keep active then it’s a good app. I planned on using it to improve my Algebra skills for a class. Unfortunately some sections only have one problem so if you don’t get it correct you’re just given an explanation and the course still moves on. 

Without having multiple problems it doesn’t reinforce the skills it’s trying to teach so some lessons are pretty much wasted. For $25 a month I expected more problems to really drill in the skills I needed. 

It’s not a bad app by any means but it’s more of a puzzle subscription than a learning tool which isn’t worth $25/month for my college budget."
2020,"Brilliant is like someone explaining a story in three sentences, then goes into EXTREME detail when you were totally fine with the three sentences. 

Like ADHD and a chatter box had a baby and became an app."
2020,"$25 is just too much for what they’re offering. I’d gladly pay 5-10/mo but I think 25 is just too much. That being said, the app is awesome there’s a ton to learn for even the most knowledgeable people."
2020,"The app is closing unexpectedly as soon as it opens, leaving a black screen in the recent apps view. Please fix this"
2020,On
2020,"As my title states, it’s been a fun experience overall, but i will need more time with the app to give it a better review. As of now I have little experience with it to determine its effectiveness. Furthermore, I have yet to compare the free experience from the premium/paid experience."
2020,I paid for monthly fee and for some odd reason it’s trying to charge me more. I have been using the logic course because I was interested but as soon as I finish the 3 starter lessons it’s locked and brings me to the “Unlock the Brilliant experience”
2020,"There is a probability question on infection rates and overall the explanation is great however the questions fails to explain a nuance that is critical to solving the problem. It explains that 96% that do not have the disease will test negative but does not explain that the 4% remaining will show as falsely positive.

Without this detail the problem is not possible to solve correctly and will be confusing to anyone trying to learn these concepts."
2020,$$$$ Yeet
2020,just a lil expensive
2020,The app does not work with voiceover and is not accessible
2020,"I think this is a very good app, I tried the freely available lessons of one course as well as a few of the daily challenges, and found them to be very didactic. The exercises are practical and explanations are clear. 

I understand asking people to pay for access to quality educational content; however, I think the current options are pricey for people who are interested in just a few specific courses, and the app would benefit from having more options for accessing the paid content.

In the app, it only mentions the $150/year subscription option, which is very expensive if someone is just interested in a few specific courses. I see in the App Store description that a monthly option is listed, but this is not mentioned in the app or provided as a option when selecting the 7-day free trial.
There should be the possibility to just pay to unlock a specific course that one is interested in taking, as a more economic alternative to getting a subscription (although perhaps ultimately less economic for the person who expects to take several or many courses and would therefore prefer the subscription).
Ideally, and especially as you add more content, I think it would be great if some full courses could be available for free, perhaps some of the more basic/intro-level ones. 
We only have two days to decide if we want to do the 7-day free trial, and I think you should give people a little more time to try the app to see if they want the trial. It would give people some flexibility about when to start their trial (so they could time it for a week when they have more free time to actually use the free trial)."
2020,Would love a lower tier of pricing to make it more accessible to most.
2020,"Great app, but needs a better free version or lower costs"
2020,"First of all I love the idea. I studied Mechanical Engineering but haven’t worked in the field for 5+ years, so I just wanted to see if I still have the understanding for all the principles and check out new fields. 
I feel like some of the explanations should have been read over by somebody else who hasn’t written it. Most of the time I don’t have issues understanding the principle or I even know it beforehand but reading the text is sometimes more confusing than clarifying. 
Still, I’m enjoying the app. Lastly I have to say that $150 per year seems really excessive for an app like this. It is not going into enough detail to prepare people for exams or anything, so all it’s for is joy/ interest in the theories. I can get that from Wikipedia or similar websites. Granted, not as organized but for free. 
I will keep browsing topics this year but I will not buy another year of subscription. At least not for this prize."
2021,This app needs a scratch pad!
2021,I signed up through apple id but I can’t access my profile
2021,"I tried it out for the electricity and magnetism and the chemistry course both have the beginning but All the good stuff...coming soon but like, how soon? Is there an expected date? Will update review"
2021,"The offline doesn't work at all. When it's online, I can download lessons and use them. But when it's offline, asking to pay for a subscription (again), and I can't use it."
2021,"I have been experiencing constant formatting errors, content not loading, app crashing when trying to resume a course and courses saved offline not being usable offline"
2021,There’s no settings or profile button in the app?
2021,This material was definitely written by experts in their respective fields but they do a very poor job of explaining things so a person with limited knowledge can understand it. I’ve been a premium member for awhile now and have a completed several courses. I am frequently at a loss as to what they are even asking due to poor presentation of the topic. If you just want to refresh knowledge then this app is great. If you want to learn new material for the first time this app is not recommended.
2021,"For most of my incorrect answers I try to learn and understand what I did wrong. For some parts the explanations are helpful but wording is so skewed that’s it’s a problem to understand without taking time longer than the initial question.

Then I found a lot of questions are open ended or hides important information that makes solving the question a logical guessing game. Example pertaining to a probability question “guess how much money would be made on average per game” the question however does not tell you how many games will be played leading the player to come with an random guess which will lead them to a wrong answer.

If the app is built for the purpose of learning or a wide range of learning levels the questions and explanations should reflect that. Instead of assuming everyone intelligence level will pick on the smallest details and understand what they already didn’t understand to begin with."
2021,"While I really like the course materials and how they structure learning, the functionality of the application and website are riddled with issues."
2021,"First of all, I love the concept behind brilliant—I love the amazingly engaging lesson presentation and quirky art style.  I’m even okay with the rather expensive subscription cost.  But I cannot stand the crashing of the app Every-Single-Time I try to review content I’ve already completed!  Completely frustrating and deserving of a single star—were it not for the amazing content.  Maybe give me a few months free or better yet hire me to fix your broken app! Grrr!!"
2021,"When moving the number tiles to solve the sodoku like puzzles, the controls were unpredictable. Sometimes they worked other times a swipe would move the whole screen left or right.
I am enjoying the app"
2021,The customer service is slow to respond and is not helpful at all. I will not continue my subscription for that reason.
2021,The latest update has stop keeping track of my stats and limited the access to a lot of content. I have played this app everyday since October of 2018. I found it both educational and entertaining but can’t afford the full app. I’ll still play but am pretty disappointed in the changes.
2021,"After months, text doesn’t go to the edges of the screen. And it appears the app isn’t hanging at launch anymore. Glad these things are fixed, but it too way too long for a subscription product."
2021,I would totally try this if you guys offered a monthly plan instead of a yearly one. But I don’t know if I’m ready to go out over 100 bucks without knowing if I like it first.
2021,"Wish it was a bit more math focused. It seems good for general knowledge. As in, I have a general knowledge of quantum mechanics for conversational purposes."
2021,"The content is worth your annual purchase. I love Brilliant and I thank them for allowing subject opportunity to many different groups of people. This site is advancing me in so many ways. 

I look forward to app upgrades with more functions. The content has no faults although the app lacks basic features that does not reflect the cost of purchase.   

For example there is so much content, I often scroll through exploring my options but there’s no way to: favorite, save, add to list - nothing, to basically bookmark something for later. 

A notes function would be GREAT. So many new concepts and things I want to remember for later but not at a desk at the moment. 

There’s plenty of room for growth as far as app and site functionality : they need to emulate online course sites that allow notes, bookmarks galore and highlighting. As long as they add features to be their fullest potential, I’ll be a yearly subscriber. 

(Brilliant already surpasses in every other aspect in comparison)"
2022,"The puzzles and content are great.  However, many of them require moving a slider left or right to change variables in the puzzles.  Often, when I try to move the slider, I end up moving between quiz steps (moving a page forward or backward) instead."
2022,"I just got a subscription, and I am trying to change settings like picture and other preferences, and it just crashes back to the courses menu. Fix this asap."
2022,Nicer
2022,"I got a code that would have saved me a little over $30 and would have supported a smaller creator, but when I put in my payment information it just take me to the app where I had to pay full price and wasn’t prompted to put in a code or anything. That’s just ridiculous and off putting if that’s the first interaction people can expect from your service. And the lack of flexibility with the payment dates is insane too."
2022,Wow
2022,"got the app to practice algebra during summer. the app doesn’t actually teach you,just give problems.  you only get the first chapter free and then it’s $150 a year. expensive for only reviewing"
2022,"Great though sometimes the courses have typos (minor thing), and the animations don’t work much of the time, like they’re not supported or something (play button has a line through it). I’m using an iPhone SE, hope this is fixed because the visuals are often crucial to understanding the lesson"
2022,"I am a civil engineer and have some background in electrical and mechanical engineering, so I was interested when Mark Rober recommended this on one of his youtube channels and included a discount link. I tried to set up an account, but for some reason, my password wasn't working, and the reset password option was not generating an email. I emailed someone that day and was able to work everything out by the following day and access the content.

After trying out a few of the lessons on the free version, I decided I would like to try the free trial I had seen after I was able to access the content (for some reason, I didn't see a trial option before I signed up), but the option was no longer visible. I emailed someone to see if I was too late for it and learned that it is only available during the first 48 hours after signing up. I checked that the discount was available still, and it showed that the yearly subscription was $119 and the monthly subscription was $18. I was hoping that maybe since I hadn't been able to access the material during the first 12+ hours after signing up and couldn't remember when I had signed up that the option might just be hiding on the checkout page. When I went to exit out of the details for the monthly option by pressing the home screen on my phone, payment was initiated, but thankfully I got an error screen saying that payment was unable to be processed. I received an email right after that saying that I had been charged the full $24. 

I canceled the subscription right away without trying it out and reached out to support again but was only told that they don't offer discounts for monthly subscriptions and that the trial version is only available for the yearly subscription during the first 48 hours after signing up. I am very bummed, and even though some of the content is interesting, I am not sure if I think the app is worth it because of all the technical difficulties and because no remedies were offered even though at least two of the issues were on their side. It would be nice if they had offered to refund me or had offered me the option to switch to the yearly subscription so I could get the discount (that said I had 16 hours left to claim when I had subscribed, so I know I wasn't past the window for that). It would also be good if they fixed the technical issues since this is a science app with a computer science course...they must know someone who can fix issues like this... I do know it takes time to fix these things though.

Anyhow, since I am stuck with a subscription, I am trying out the physics and science classes I really enjoyed with the free version, so hopefully, it makes up for all the problems. 🤞"
2022,I enjoy having some puzzles to work on but the price for a monthly subscription is kinda gross. And I don’t like that every class is held back because of it.
2022,The puzzles are enjoyable and entertaining. This is not for someone who wants to seriously learn math and sciences. You end up consuming too much time not solving challenging problems.
2022,"Ev err y time I open the app and a clad, I have to go through every lesson again selecting finish and then continue for each lesson I’ve already completed to get to where I left off. Annoying, often enough to not bother with a lesson. Other wise great lessons and options to learn."
2022,"Too glitchy… no way to report problems…. Not enough variations to let me learn and try again. 
I do appreciate the availability of hints, but a better program would ask what my ideas are and build from there rather than pigeonhole everyone to think the same way."
2022,"I'll preface this by saying I've only done two of the courses so far: Introduction to Linear algebra and Linear Algebra with Applications. 

So I bought into the idea that Brilliant was going to be a fresh new approach on learning that employed a research backed blend of teaching and quizzes. But I've been disappointed, the questions are often too challenging and not suitable for someone new to a subject, and the teaching is light and not sufficient to answer the questions they ask. 

Many of the questions which are typically ""gotcha"" style questions where the answer is often counter intuitive or a trick. I think these types of questions have a place and are useful once you have a really solid understanding of the material, but they are not suitable for someone new to a subject. Even with the explanations I sometimes still dont understand the question or the subject. There also just aren't enough questions on a topic to really test your understanding properly. More repetition is needed to really grasp a new subject. 

The lack of good teaching while its frustrating is OK given theres so much free content available everywhere now - for example Khan Academy do a much better job on the teaching side of things on the topics I've been working on. But what I really wish they would improve on first is the questions and answers they provide, both in terms of quality and quantity. At least just start relatively simple with questions that can actually be answered by what little teaching you provide and then build towards the tricky questions. This is what I would potentially pay $150/year for, but right now, quite frankly I feel a bit ripped off."
2022,"Have been using Brilliant for a long time. When they closed the online community to focus on course development, I was excited to see some fresh new contents. However, they disappointed me again and again. Not only some unfinished chapters within existing courses are still missing at large, but also the long-awaited real analysis course was even removed from the “coming soon” list. Sad."
2022,Some lessons are really well made but others are straight up confusing with explanations that don’t make sense. It’s fine as a supplement to studying but expect to be clicking random answers lots of times
2022,"Overall a great service. But a few of my criticisms are

1. There are a few grammar mistakes and some words get cut off. And on my Mac the website will freeze if I take too long on a problem

2. When I was learning about logarithms and trig, I felt like there weren’t enough problems to really know if I learned the material or not. I thought I did, but when I took a test on trig I did horrible"
2022,The majority of lessons (on the iPad) are presented in a small typeface that takes up about a third of the width of the screen in landscape mode with a keyboard.  You can’t make the text larger with Dynamic Type—it just ignores it.  Also does not keep track of daily problem streaks.
2022,App is buggy. Answer blocks show up but all answers are the same and missing the selection. Not sure if this app ever did work well. I’ve stuck with the website.
2022,The quality of questions is good and the way concepts are built is also nice. I just don’t think the price is justified. It’s way too expensive.
2022,Title says everything.
2022,"I think this app looks great, and fit exactly what I was looking for.  

The thing I didn’t like was that they don’t tell you that you need to pay a $100+ yearly fee until AFTER you’ve answered questions about how you’d use the app and created an account…   Please be more up front about your pricing.  I’m not mad about the cost of the subscription, just the fact that they spring it on you AFTER you’ve given them some of your personal data to sell.  It feels a bit sneaky."
2022,We need Arabic support
2023,"I tried the app with high expectations after seeing some really cool animations/visualizations, but walked away quite disappointed. 
The app is buggy: buttons freeze easily and had to relaunch the app multiple times and even reinstall. 
Most importantly, the courses are put together disjointly. I constantly finding myself questioning why I’m giving the challenges for no obvious reason. I don’t see the point of many of the exercises. Maybe the quality varies course by course and I just haven’t found the good ones? 
Any way, it’s a let down and I’m not ready to sink 150 for an annual subscription."
2023,"While I quite enjoy the app and it is part of my daily routine, that it resets my daily streak simply because I am in a new time zone every time I travel - even though it is still the same day in both previous and current time zones is quite annoying. Brilliant, sometimes people travel. Making the streak mean number of days used in this specific time zone, is a silly.

I’ve changed my 5 star review to 3 stars until this is fixed."
2023,"I’ve used this app for two months despite the price is a little high, aren’t enough updating courses, I want to have dark mode cuz every time at night it’s killing my eyeballs. Overall this is an undoubtably good app"
2023,I love brilliant but none of the courses will load and I can’t do anything with the app even though I just got it.
2023,"I love this app.
Last week, I would’ve given 5 stars. 

Now, it’s transformed into an app I no longer get excited about or want to use. 
As a visual learner, being able to associate topics with images and multi-dimensional organization was one of the most appealing things about the course catalogs. The removal of images and re-organization into one large, boring timeline has easily taken the UI down several stars, and I’m unable to revert to the previous formatting. If this doesn’t get changed back, I’ll most likely be unsubscribing very soon. 

Devs, please go back to the previous format of the course catalog that had the images and broke the course down into horizontal and vertical stacks. It took the app to a different level, and without it, the experience suffers greatly."
