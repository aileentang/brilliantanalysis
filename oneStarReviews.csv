year,review
2015,"This app is basically spam. It's a fun brain challenge, but the emails and pop ups are beyond annoying, and it won't let me unsubscribe."
2016,"Not just the first, but the second pop up!"
2016,This app is the worst app I have ever downloaded in my entire life.
2016,"Ever since installing the app, my email is flooded with all kind of spam. The whole point of the app appears to be to sell your name to lists of poor quality, and uninteresting, advertisers. It's impossible to adjust this setting *in* the app - maybe online...and it annoys the heck out of me. App also decided to re-install itself after I deleted it for the first time. 

I got the app as I knew one of Brilliant.org'a founders from his contributions to math stackexchange, where he seemed reasonable. I would have never guessed he'd produce such low slime."
2016,Some of the questions have multiple answers that will count as wrong.
2016,"Great idea, but (expensive) in-app purchases make learning difficult for users and defeats the purpose. Maybe revenue could be made through ads."
2016,"Why is it that everything want access to your Facebook account or to your email? I choose to log in through gmail, because I don't want these stupid apps posting things on my Facebook page, but I guess gmail and google+ aren't the same thing, so it won't allow your. You're an app, not a social network, stop forcing us to give you our information."
2016,TMI: requires registration to read the privacy policy or try the app. Deleting the app is the best choice.
2016,Dont get this app. I have unsubscribed from the email list numerous times and they still spam my inbox with their crap.
2016,All apps that require the user to create an account before they can see what the app offers are crap and get one star because I can't give zero stars.
2016,The new update is failure.
2017,"I originally got this app, because I thought it would be fun brain teasers that I could do in my spare time. It's not. The problems jump from easy to difficult and rarely are there problems you can do in 5 spare minutes. I'm not saying that's the case for everyone, but the problems are such that even though I've taken ode's I can't just brain my way through them, and as a student I don't have time to write them down with pen and paper. If you do have that kind of time, great, but it's not what I had expected from what was advertised."
2017,Why can't you buy a pack of gum these days without a follow-up survey about he experience?
2017,I keep trying to use the app but it won't load. I've restarted my iPad so many times but it won't load. If I could rate it lower I would.
2017,"More than once these Brilliant.org ads have no solution, yet they say that 37% of people get it right. This just triggers me in so many ways. You have so many advanced topics yet these mistakes are shown."
2017,"I was charged for an extra month. Of course, subscription info is buried so deep on the website that I was only able to find it via a link in the help forums. There is no visible record of your subscription, i.e. no dates listed. Finally, I wasn't able to find an email address or phone number to actually talk to someone."
2017,But it is so full of bugs it gets really frustrating working with it.  How about testing it thoroughly before release??
2017,"Buyer Beware that when you purchase the $5/mth... it's actually $60 up front for a year.  Also they force you to setup for auto renewal in hopes that many will forget. With the first $60 deal you are not entitled to full access.  The curriculum topics require more $ to sign up for ""premium"" after that.

Good app, but financially this is a scam."
2017,"All the equations appears with HTML tags in plain text. Please fix it. 
It would be also good to have a way to report issues directly to you instead of using Store review."
2017,"I hate apps that force me to do a review. Most apps give you three option: 1) I like the app, thus ask you to do a review 2) I don’t like the app thus, ask you for feed back 3) option to opt out. #3 is important as I like to wait and use an app for a while.

It’s too bad to as I was liking the app and seriously thinking of subscribing. Now I’m not sure, because this is a sign of marketing tactics I don’t like."
2018,"I downloaded this app thinking that I could keep my brain going through summer vacation but there’s a big problem that other people haven’t mentioned in their reviews. This app doesn’t really teach you anything. For example: I wanted to learn more about astronomy so I chose that course. But when start the introduction thinking that it’ll teach me the basics, the app just assumes I know all of these equations and vocabulary words. I know this probably won’t get fixed anywhere in the near future or at all because it would mean adding in ALOT more stuff but, I just wanted to warn other people. <:)"
2018,"I realized that this app is not for all ages.😪😪😪I put in the lowest year witch is 12-13
years old but it’s to hard.Maybe I will rate this game higher in the future when you make it for all ages.By the way Im only 8"
2018,"App claimed the International Space Station (ISS) is ‘weightless.’  This is a slightly erroneous term but usually a forgivable mistake, if uttered by a layperson.  However, as this is an educational app, I believe it should be held to higher standards and user proper rhetoric.  Honestly, I am greatly disappointed because I was excited to learn some new trivia!  It is a great injustice that this app is propagating slightly skewed information.  I would find it a better exercise to fully explain the idea rather than hastily throw out a common misnomer, which even further normalizes this incorrect sentiment.  Knowing that people who are not already well-verses in physics would probably not recognize this mistake makes it an even more egregious error!

I am fed up with the educational system opting out of truly explaining difficult subjects.  There is this trend of substituting them with slightly incorrect, water-downed, and much easier to explain versions of the true problem statement.  The responsibility should lie within the institution to face this challenges comprehensively, so that we can build a model for the general public that cohesively explains such difficult subject matter."
2018,"Where is the actual course content? The entire app is just questions but if you're never given any content to learn, how does one know they are getting better with a subject?"
2018,"Put down the barbarians, stop all the flossing and try some math for a change. Brilliant is a fun app you can actually feel good about wasting a few minutes on.

Sadly, it’s too expensive. The annually-renewing premium option costs more than a fancy graphing calculator. The monthly option costs more than every other subscription service I keep combined. I’m willing to pay, but not that much!"
2018,"Don’t sign up for a year before you try the paid content!

I found that the content was VERY poor in some places, including outright errors in the paid content. For example, I was given an explanation to a puzzle where all dragons had red eyes (as opposed to blue eyes) and the solution said one of them has blue eyes. The solution was also worded so poorly I had to read it four times to understand what they meant even. For reference, I am an experienced attorney - logic problems and reading do not come hard for me.

I signed up for the yearly program with the expectation from the free content that what was in the paid content would be on par, but it was majorly inferior. Additionally, the mobile experience was poorly conceived and functioned intermittently. A complete disappointment. 

I asked to cancel after a couple of hours into the monthly/1 year signup and they refused, asking me to find a way to enjoy the next 364 more days of this horrible app.  F- for customer service. Shameful.

So try it if you like, but don’t sign up for more than a month until you get to see the app for the below-standard work that it is... or at least to know you like it."
2018,"If you’re looking for an app to learn math and scientific terms this is not it, this app is for those who already have that knowledge and is simply just articles and tests to stimulate not teach. Not a single bit of the content is set up to teach you anything you have to come in to this with quite a bit of prior knowledge for this app to be useful."
2018,"I absolutely adored this app for six years. With very few exceptions, I worked on the problems of the week, every week, for six years. Then they took away problems of the week, a beautiful format with well organized and interesting problems. They replaced it with problems of the day, a format with no coherent organization, and a noticeable lapse in quality. The departure from the original soul of the app is astonishing. 

Brilliant developers, roll back this change or I will be forced to find my recreational math fix elsewhere."
2018,"I wanted to learn about physics. I used Khan Academy for a bit, but then I found Brilliant. I will still admit that it’s approach to teaching STEM is extremely innovative and captivating. loved it, but it wouldn’t let me advance far without paying money. If you want to gain an advanced understanding of a topic and don’t want to pay for it, don’t waste your time with Brilliant. There are free options, like Khan Academy."
2018,"This app will bill you $105.45 to use the puzzles . They give you access for a year and bill it all at one even though you choose the monthly billing option. When I went to immediately cancel the subscription (less than 1 minute later) , I was told no refund. Absurd rip off. You can cancel the automatic renewal but they won’t do even a partial prorated refund. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP !
Hello!

I’m very sorry to hear that Brilliant Premium isn’t meeting your expectations. As someone struggling to learn these same subjects, I’m familiar with the bitter frustration of a resource or textbook not meeting my needs.

As laid out in terms of service, I cannot provide you with a refund. If you would like to cancel your subscription to ensure that it’s not renewed, you can do so on the Subscription page of your account settings.

I personally wish we could provide refunds to everyone who is dissatisfied, but it is currently against our internal policies. Brilliant Premium has tens of thousands of happy subscribers paying every month or year, and the majority of them are problem-solving each month, and I’d love to keep you as a member of that group.

To that end, if you have any specific feedback or requests, I’m eager to be your advocate inside of Brilliant and work until you’re satisfied with our service – just let me know what you feel like we’re missing or not getting right.

Warm regards,
Karen"
2018,Think twice before signing up. Realized a few minutes after signing up that my schedule would be clear a few months into next year where I could better utilize a Brilliant subscription. Informed customer support to cancel the pending transaction and was told that there is a no refund policy. Ridiculous.
2018,In the opening slides of the app they try to demonise other methods of learning by saying “it is hard to learn from lectures and videos”. This form of minor brainwashing is not acceptable.
2018,It’s so dumb because it makes it look like its all free and fun and knowledge but then it only lets you learn the introduction. Don’t download this app if you don’t want to pay for premium.  You need premium for EVERTHING you get nothing without paying. Please do something about it and I will rate easily 5 starts because the app itself is great.
2018,Please don't make me.
2018,"I downloaded this app a week ago and was instantly hooked. I got a yearly subscription and enjoyed it for 5 days. But now everything requires premium. I was in the middle of the science essential course and to continue on I had to get premium. I looked at all courses and all future lessons are locked, forcing me to get premium in order to learn. I payed $100 for a yearly subscription, now I have to pay another $100 to keep going? A developer please help so I can continue my passion, learning."
2018,"Tried to take advantage of 20% discount when buying a full year subscription, but was charged full price. App Store says family sharing is available, but it is not. Customer service (?) has been hard to find and now is non responsive. I will change this review of the problems are solved."
2019,"I was charged twice and have contacted support, I haven’t received a response(I checked my email and when I click sent it shows that I didn’t even send brilliant an email even though I did) . I paid for the annual subscription (which totaled to 102$ when I bought on a 20% discount). The app/website was still offering me premium which meant it didn’t go through(I assumed that it didn’t charge me). I bought it again without the discount(totaled to 120$) it went through this time but when I checked my bank account I realized I was charged twice( 102$ and 120$). Need my money back."
2019,"Incredibly deceptive trial cancellation practice. Customer service communication sends you in loops and the app conveniently malfunctioned not allowing me to cancel my trial until AFTER the deadline. Once available, the cancellation process requires a ridiculous number of “Are you SURE you want to cancel” questions and other processes meant to trick you into continuing your cancellation request. Customer service emails are not responded to in a timely manner and require several emails to convey information like “go here and fill out this request” - which at best illustrates incompetence and at worst deceptive business practices. All of the above renders the app useless - if you cannot stand behind your product on substance alone and must resort to such practices to gain subscriptions, then even you clearly don’t believe in your product."
2019,"The app is really cool. Some reviews state that there are incorrect answers to some problems but I can’t say I ever saw that. I’d honestly give it 5 stars if not for the absolute joke that is their customer service. 

If you email them to cancel you get ignored. If you email asking for a refund you get told they don’t issue refunds. And if you try to cancel on the app you get several pages of “are you sure you want to cancel?”. Fine, lots of places do that. BUT (and this is the key part) most places will eventually allow you to cancel. Not Brilliant. When you get to the final “yes I definitely want to cancel” screen you have two buttons to push. The one that says cancel and the one that says you don’t want to cancel. Clicking cancel does.....absolutely nothing. I’ve tried multiple times over 8 days to cancel. I’ve tried restarting my phone, logging in and out, deleting the app....nothing works. But if you click the one that says you don’t want to cancel it immediately responds to the input and takes you back to the main app. Try to cancel again, go through 4 pages of desperate attempts to make you reconsider, hit the final cancel button....and again nothing.

This is a joke. I’ve contacted my credit card company and started a dispute. If you think you might want to try the app my only suggestion is that you don’t. It’s a cool app run by obviously amoral people who have what is a completely unethical cancellation policy. I’m not even trying to get a refund at this point, all I want is to cancel my subscription and I can’t."
2019,"I thought it was a good app until I realized that you can only use 1/4 of the app if your not a premium member. I had high expectations, they got crushed"
2019,Does absolutely nothing unless you sign up for a 7 day free trial of a paid subscription. And of course it doesn’t tell you this until after you create an account. App deleted.
2019,I don’t know how this app has so many positive reviews or where they are buying them. The quizzes test information that is often irrelevant to the subject matter. There’s no educational information provided upfront. When you go into detailed explanations they are usually too complex as the app has completely skipped over key knowledge necessary to understand them.
2019,This app is a scam. View the reviews by most recent and you can see that most of them are fake. Do NOT get the premium subscription. Shockingly pricey-impossible to cancel.
2019,"I get it, it’s in the small print. A good app shouldn’t have to rely on a “gotcha” that someone’s *technically* agreed to, to maintain a user base. A good app should motivate the users to renew voluntarily. If you’ve got a good app that people like, you won’t have to worry about it.

Cancelling the Premium account requires what felt like 10 confirmation pages, which is frankly pathetic and petty.

There aren’t really lessons, just exercises pretending to be lessons. They’re difficult but not impossible, and genuinely interesting. But it ends there - they’re just “interesting.” The lessons are ultimately cursory explorations of each topic with no real goal for mastering the material. It was enriching, but not practically useful. Enriching is good, enriching is its own good. But simply “enriching” isn’t worth $120 every year, and it certainly isn’t worth $25 every month. There’s better, more in-depth materials out there that’re either cheaper or free. Why pay so much to just know things about things, instead of actually *knowing* the things?

If you can afford $600 for the lifetime subscription literally just go [back to] college."
2019,Just published an iOS 13 update 3 days ago but it does not support Sign In with Apple. Apple why are you promoting Apps that aren’t helping protect user privacy?
2019,"That should be the real tag line, ""Math and physical and computer science only"" because apparently the developer either knew nothing about biological and chemical science or they didn't have any friends to help them with this part of the app. There is no mention of chemistry, organic chemistry (which I argue is harder than many of the courses in there now), molecular biology, or any of the myriad of advanced or beginner subject that may fall under those broad headings.  I downloaded the app hoping to use it for some study help worth some masters courses in molecular biology but, nope...computational biology is as close as it gets and that is really just a programmer course for people that can speak Python or some other language. 
If they can get some of these subjects added I will definitely be back, I like the look and feel of the app. 

So, good luck and let's hop to boys, let's get those subjects added and the future biochemist learning!!"
2019,I would've enjoyed this Educational game/app. Neat basic logic puzzles but they make you pay for it so I’m out.
2019,"I want to love this app. The idea of focusing in solving problems to learn is great. Sadly, this program falls into the same trap that too many dusty math textbooks fall for. That is tricking the reader with language. Too often the questions are confusing and read like a riddles. My first instinct is to treat the problem as trick that Brilliant is trying to trap me with. This leads to incorrect answers and that discourages me from participating (or enjoying math)."
2019,"Good but not great and definitely not worth paying for. 

Too much bait and switch. For me to pay for something like this, the content better be perfect. This is far from perfect. Too much is assumed about the learner. 

Additionally, they app and web site are well design and look pretty but after using the product on and off for two years I can say with confidence that pretty/slick design does nothing to enhance learning. I guess what I mean is this app is basically Wikipedia in condensed form, with a layer of sugar on top to make it go down easier."
2019,I’ve only used the product for a few days so far and I already love it. But I I chose the yearly plan instead of the monthly plan. And I don’t have that type of money. On the website it says that it shows the money on the pay button but it didn’t. And I’ve tried to contact support six times already but no ones gotten back to me. Don’t get me wrong I like the app but the customer service is terrible.
2019,Continually says content not loaded. There is no support for this app.
2019,"Their Customer Support is lacking. After being unable to cancel online, I wrote to cancel my subscription and to get a refund after being auto-billed a week ago.

They still have not gotten back."
2019,"Well designed courses with simple explanations but their customer support is terrible. 
I completely forgot to cancel my subscription this month and when I asked for a refund they never responded. Still waiting. 

It’s unfortunate for a company to create such a beautiful app but have terrible customer service."
2019,"I cancelled my trial,  but they charged me for a year subscription anyway.  When I tried to contact support, they didn’t answer.  Two days later and still no response.  I had to go through my bank and report the transaction as fraudulent.  Don’t trust these people."
2019,"Developers, stop doing this.

Putting Facebook integration up front = Probably also Hide Purchase."
2019,"I’m not quite sure who would pay either the monthly or yearly subscription for content that is easily found for a fraction of the cost elsewhere. I’m still trying to find the justification of the apps price point but nothing has jumped out other than the UX. 

The free version is almost a joke to download too. 

Also to add to other reviews the content is lacking in areas that make the price point even less worth it. 

TLDR: If you really want to learn a subject buy a textbook pdf online or look elsewhere as you will probably learn more in depth and save money."
2020,"“Our Services do not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we collect information about your online activity both while you are using the Services and after you leave our Services.”

Looks like it may be good otherwise...I won’t be finding out."
2020,"Please remember to cancel your subscription  if you’re just checking out the free trial. The subscription model is only available in one tier, $119.00 per year. This seems exceedingly high for an iPhone app. it’s a learning app not professional software. Regardless  set a reminder to cancel. So many apps switching over to this business model, you can’t even download an alarm app anymore without paying 10.00 a month. Use Brilliant for 10 years and you’ll pay $1,190.00 and you still won’t even own it."
2020,"They will charge your card durning trail, and continue to renew subscription, more like a scam once they get hold of your credit card numbers, your only option is to cancel the card and get a new one.(as I did)"
2020,"I spent at least 20 minutes trying to figure out how to use it just so I can put in my problem and it doesn’t even give me a straight answer! It says that it will solve math and science problems and explain it to you, but the only thing it does is waste your time!"
2020,"Using the free week, I did the first chapters of 3 courses. The Logic course was fun. The computer science fundamentals was interesting. I had never encountered graphs as anything other that x,y and maybe z axes on a plane. Algorithm Fundamentals however was just too rife with unexplained assumptions and outright errors. 
I had hoped I would learn more than the fact that I need to learn more. Real educators derive joy from seeing students learn. This app has been developed by “educated” (possibly) who seem to believe its users are educated as well. But if I were educated, why the “hail” would I need the app?
Save your $149, unless you simply want confirmation that you need to know more, because that is all you will go away having obtained."
2020,"I downloaded the app for the logic portion and it was good; however, timing wasn’t good for me to fully make use of it. I canceled well within the 7-day trial and received confirmation of canceling. After that I went ahead and deleted my account where Brilliant gives several stern warnings that *all* of your information will be deleted and can’t be retrieved if you delete your account. Imagine my surprise when my PayPal account was charged for a full year several days after I had canceled and supposedly deleted my account!! They lied about the 7-day trial and they lied about all of my information being deleted. I contacted customer support and received a nice email from Kenzie and provided them with PayPal info to reimburse me for the incorrect charge. This was 2 weeks ago and I’ve yet to be reimbursed. 

While I feel fairly certain this review will cause some movement, it shouldn’t have to come to this when all of their guidelines were followed. Caveat emptor with this product.

*********

Update: As I suspected, within several hours of writing the above review, I received an email from Brilliant saying they weren’t in the practice of providing refunds but they would make an exception in my case. 

Imagine - I gave them email proof of having canceled well within the 7-day trial period after which they erroneously charged me for a year subscription (despite claims that all my information was fully wiped from their system when I deleted my account the same day I canceled the 7-day trial) - even in situations when they’re at fault, it’s not their practice to give refunds. The simplicity of their business model to make money is stunningly anticonsumer. 

My original assessment stands: caveat emptor with this app and the company behind it."
2020,I tried the free trial and soon as I accept a free trial I always cancel in my subscriptions so I won’t forget. It showed expired in my subscriptions but a declined charged came to my account of 119.99 for a annual payment. I would not recommend based off of this sneaky charge that clearly states they will not charge up to a day before renewal.
2020,"First off, this app doesn’t actually teach you, it’s a series of gotcha questions that may be beneficial if you already have knowledge of the subjects and just want a review, but there are no lessons, this is a prime example of a minimum viable product with an expensive subscription. Now, after barely using the app due to dissatisfaction with the “learning” possibilities, I’m slapped with $100 charge for another year right as the holidays are coming up, and I don’t have an extra $100 lying around to spend on myself. There was no warning that my subscription renewal was coming, or how much it was going to be. (I bought the first year on a sale for $60 last year) As far as I know, there is no way of getting that back. When I cancelled the subscription in the app, I had to endure 5 huge screens of scrolling where the company either pathetically begged me to stay, or threatened me with a higher price if I ever dared come back. They must not get many people coming back if they treat them with this vindictive manner on the way out the door. After that, I’m not motivated to go to their customer support and try to get my money back, because the one thing they have taught me is that I won’t get anywhere with that."
2020,"Signed up for the free trial thinking it might be a good activity during paternity leave. Baby came early, and that distraction contributed to my forgetting to cancel. They charged me for a full year and would not even do a partial refund."
2020,$150 per year is outrageous for an iPhone app.  I wish you’d mentioned the price in the app description before I wasted my time downloading the app.
2020,"It’s shameful that you price this app at $150, out of reach of the majority of people who are poor or lower middle class."
2020,Finally I gave in and reviewed the app.
2020,"I’ve had this app going on my second week now, and I have 25$ subscription, but it won’t let me get access to all the classes and keeps trying to get me to buy the year subscription. I messaged them for help still haven’t received any help or a refund. 😕"
2020,"All the positive reviews must be paid for. The lessons seem cool and intuitive at first, but as soon as things start getting difficult it starts to read like a textbook. 

I also bought this app for the sole purpose of completing the lessons offline while I am on an airplane. After I purchased a year-long subscription, they implemented a limit of 6 offline downloads per month. Do not understand why they have the limitation. It seems like completely unnecessary BS. Also, if they update your downloaded lesson before you use it, they completely disable it, instead of updating the download or just letting you use the old version of the lesson."
2020,Matrices and vectors in linear algebra have zero visualization. Paid $100 for something I can get for free anywhere online. Waste of my money
2020,"There is no way to be certain I am unsubscribed before deleting the app.  I do not want to start the free trial, but there is no way to be sure I haven’t, and no way to make sure I won’t be charged the subscription fee."
2020,"I didn’t know there was a $149.99 fee until AFTER giving up some of my information. Granted, there is a free trial first and then the yearly fee of $149.99, but I think it would have felt more above board if that was made clear before ever downloading the app.  Not good."
2020,I be broke
2020,Bait and switch. Drop it now.
2020,"For an entire I couldn’t reach the support team to cancel the subscription. They claim to respond in a coupe of days, and no one ever did reach out. I rarely see subscription app acting so vulgar to take people’s money."
2020,Frustrating ripoff
2020,"The app is ok, but way overpriced. There are better services for way cheaper. I think people should expect more for there money and for what they are asking you should expect a lot more wolfram alpha don’t cost much and they are not #1 I’m saying if your spending $150/ year you should get a lot more for your money. This will also be posted on the website so if you ever want to see the best rated apps plz go there. SRB"
2020,Brilliant.org is cool but this app is painful to look at.
2020,Unable to start the app. Close automatically.
2020,"They never responded to my report on a bug. Going through a course it keeps loosing my progress on random lessons and I can’t continue until I do them over again, and again, and again. I finally started screen shooting every quiz so I can just fill in the puzzles I got CORRECT again and move on to something new to learn... I barely use the app because it’s so frustrating. I should’ve cancelled after trial period.. oh well."
2020,I think the true brilliance test is realizing it’s $149/year after 7 days and deleting the app.
2020,They make you think you are paying by the month but they charge you for a year and refuse refunds when requested.  Stay away.
2020,"Looks like an amazing app. However, I shouldn't have to sign up or register to use it. Yet another promising app gets deleted."
2020,"Download is free and the sign up workflow requires personal information be entered before you are presented with the information that this is a pricey subscription based app.  If you want to understand the cost of using this app before offering up personal information, you will find the subscription info in the detailed description."
2020,"I wrote the following review back in the early part of April and, like many other reviewers have stated,  still have not gotten any type of response. Can we please get a one time purchase option for the whole thing or for sections? 

PREVIOUS REVIEW:

For the love of God, more pricing options please!!

Oh, how I hate subscriptions? First of all, I don't want to learn everything on your app so don't charge me for access to everything. Second of all, just charge one flat fee for each subject, if you must...but this subscription crap is for the birds! I wanted to like this app soooo bad but I'm not paying a subscription for ANY app so if you want me (and others like me) to use this app then charge a one-time REASONABLE fee for each section and be done with it (or at the very least - offer a lifetime subscription at a reasonable price). What happens if for whatever reason, I pay for yearly or monthly and then for a month I can't study because oh, I don't know...life gets in the way? Then what? So I've paid for something that I didn't even access for a pay period? For what you are asking for in one year WITH YOUR DISCOUNT OFFER, I paid less than but close to half of that for a lifetime subscription to another app that is comparable to your app. If I was mean, I would put the name of the app so other people could check it out, but I won't do you like that. Just know that I've seen other reviews on other apps that were unhappy and they mentioned other apps instead and guess what, they saved me the trouble of searching for the apps that were better than the one that they were reviewing. 

I do like your app but not for the price option that you are offering. Most places do subscriptions hoping that the subscriber will forget and keep getting that chunk of money taken but there are those of us that do not fall for that trap so you are missing a whole market segment of people who would actually buy your product. 

I'm sorry my review is so long but I hope that you can hear that you have a potential customer in me and that I really like your product. I think I was just taken aback because I thought the learning content was free and the extra practice and other goodies was the subscription. Imagine my surprise when I discovered that virtually everything is locked behind a subscription paywall!

I SO WANTED TO LIKE THIS APP...

...but I'm disappointed in this app instead

Please do something about your price structure so I can get it and give a more favorable review. Thank you for your time and consideration."
2020,"After trying to purchase the premium subscription, I was billed for $24.99 and was still unable to access the premium content. I attempted to seek assistance and I was very lazily and coldly told to simply request a refund from Apple instead of any attempt to resolve the complaint. Extremely disappointed that I have to go through this. Do not purchase the premium content for this app."
2020,I was billed for a whole year but can’t use the Premium features. Have not heard back from the app. Stay away
2020,"I have a brand spankin’ new iPhone 11, the latest OS version, a strong internet connection and over 90% of my storage left. Theres no reason this app should crash every 2 minutes. Anyone else having this problem?

Also, its disgusting how expensive this is. This app has incredibly useful knowledge and can actually have a powerful impact on society. It piques the interest of those who may not have previously been academically-inclined and can supplement the education of those that are struggling with certain concepts and/or don't have access to a high-quality education. Even people who don’t give a crap about the academic content will be interested in the games/puzzles and will benefit from strengthened logic and reasoning skills. 

$100+ is unaffordable for those living in poverty and the lower middle class, a.k.a THE PEOPLE WHO WOULD APPRECIATE AND BENEFIT FROM THIS APP THE MOST. This is yet another system letting the rich gain more while the poor fall further behind. The rich already go to higher quality schools, live in communities where education is actually a priority since food, shelter, and safety aren’t concerns, and have (relatively) easy funding for things such as tutoring services and college. And what do the poor get?? Certainly not this app!

Your company is feeding into the cycle of systemic racism and it is incredibly greedy. What about this app makes it so extravagantly priced? All the information in this app can be found for free on the internet, so its not like you're asking people to pay for some God-tier forbidden knowledge. This is an amazing app (despite the crashing) and it is very well put together, but there are THOUSANDS of other high-quality apps that are completely free or SIGNIFICANTLY less expensive. Why are gaming and puzzle apps with more intricate design cheaper than an educational app?? It should be the other way around, if not the same. Knowledge should not be a luxury. I just don’t get it. 

Im sure y’all need money, but asking for a couple bucks a month would be wayyyy more understandable and might actually end up giving you guys a bigger profit since more people would be willing to pay. If you really want to make money, work with school districts. I’m sure a lot of schools would want to integrate your content into their classrooms. Students would have easy access to learn about new things, and your lessons would be a fun way to supplement whatever content is already being taught. 

Just my thoughts  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Im a high school teacher from America if you can’t tell."
2020,"Don’t get this if you want to learn math or science. It’s simply a series of poorly designed and poorly explained puzzles for those who already know the material. I wanted an educational experience and I really wanted to like Brilliant, but in the end it is simply a miserable experience."
2020,"Brilliant at first seemed “brilliant”. Then, as I was extolling the virtues of this app to my 9-year old daughter while getting her logged in with her Gmail account, we were presented with the notice “No Family Linked Gmail Accounts May Be Used” (paraphrasing).

Thanks so much developers of Brilliant. We parents seeking to protect our young children from being mined mercilessly for information just got the door slammed in our faces by what “appears” to be a youth focused educational app. 

As much value as your app may portend, it means nothing if its use compromises my child’s internet safety. And I gotta think you KNEW this because you’re brilliant after all. 

Time to move on to other educational apps placing my child’s safety above their desire to extract and resell ANY bits of information about their minor users."
2020,"I have a yearly subscription and they are unable to validate, even though I provided both my email and proof via Apple subscription.  They pawned me off to Apple saying they can’t find the subscription - after about a month of not hearing from them.  Don’t waste your time."
2020,"I canceled this account a month after starting it from the app itself. Apparently it set up a PayPal subscription, so just canceling it from the app wasn’t enough. $95.88 came out of my account this morning!"
2020,This is a scam do NOT buy this crap.  I have tried for three hours to cancel my subsection to this crap which I don’t like and have never used and guess what they have removed the cancel subscription button...so there is NO way to get out of paying 149 a year for the rest of your life.  What a scam.  I have spent three hrs trying to cancel this and read many article on line how to do this.  I am Ivy League educated and have developed many significant breakthroughs yet I can’t cancel this after three hours of work....you have been warned.
2020,Making me do everything three times because the progress is not saved is beyond annoying.
2020,"I saw Brilliant’s ad on IG, clicked the link that took me to the Apple store and downloaded the app. Put in my credit card info, gave it a try and cancelled the day or second day after, way before the trial period ended.
I cancelled using the “subscription manager” tab on the iPhone.
THEY STILL CHARGED ME $120!, and now they argue that they cannot refund a subscription made through the Apple store/iTunes. I contacted Apple and they replied with a simple question: “does the charge on your statement says Apple or Brilliant?” It says Brilliant with a receipt number, and Apple said “our subscriptions or charges say Apple.com/bill”, so Brilliant should issue the refund.
I have exchanged several emails with Kenzie from Brilliant, and he still insists that the refund has to come from Apple.
I will have to deal with this through my bank, I gave them the chance to make it good.
SCAMMERS."
2021,"Only offers a few lessons in the free version and in the App’s info on this page it lists the price of an annual membership as $119, however when you look at the actual price in the app, it’s $149 instead! And they’re trying to pass it off as a limited-time sale too!! False advertising and dishonest marketing will be the downfall of this app. It had such promise too; I really liked the design interface and the approach to learning, but I’m not going to support companies that use bait-and-switch tactics."
2021,We paid for a 1 year subscription and we can not access it.   Customer service is awful.     No live chat.   No phone number.   Only an email which they take days to respond to.   Wr have been trying for 7 months to access tge subscription and still can not solve the problem.    FRAUD.     Kerp your distance from these incompetents.
2021,"I have been trying to get in contact for assistance on my account renewal and NO ONE has returned any of my emails!  I would not recommend this app, as no one will help you with questions."
2021,"After the update to v5, I do not have practice icon. I am not getting chapter wise practice problems. The previous version is in one of the device and I am able to do them in it but not in the devices that have updated version.

The app is great with many challenging problems but now I’m not able to access those problems.

Please fix this!"
2021,I started my free trial for the app but it won’t work because when I try to do something it do anything
2021,"Wish I could add the screenshot.
And sorry because I do think it is the right approach."
2021,"All screens were white except for the “more” tab. Stayed on for 5 minutes, tried changing from WiFi to data and didn’t help :("
2021,"Trying to subscribe, but the password reset is broken, so you can’t actually log in! I guess the app must have gone out of business, as this is pretty basic. Sad, because it looked cool!"
2021,"Got a premium subscription and quickly lost interest in the app and forgot I had it. I didn’t remember I had the app until I got charged for the next years subscription in advance. Downgraded my subscription from premium because I never use this app. I asked for a pro rated refund, not the entire thing which I thought was fair. Against their policy. 0 stars. There are a lot of other things I would rather spend that 75$ on now I get to slowly watch it get wasted over the next year."
2021,"I bought this application a year ago and used it for a while. The content is so extremely boring! I stopped using it. Indeed, I forgot that I even owned it. That is until the automatic subscription renewal came up. I canceled it the day after, hoping that my $119 would be refunded. No luck.

IF YOU TRY THIS APP MAKE SURE THAT YOU DO NOT ENABLE AUTOMATIC RENEWAL!"
2021,When I try to download a course the app crashes.
2021,"So I’m a younger person and i made an easier email so I can remember and every time I try creating an account the thing says
Typo alert on the email part and I can’t made an account. I’m putting a 1 star review cause I haven’t been able to use the app yet and it’s already annoying, so if your using this app make sure you have a complicated email"
2021,When I load the app after I logged in nothing appears on screen and none of the menu buttons work
2021,"The concept of labeling this as a monthly fee charged per annum is absolutely gluttonous. The actual usability of this app is only consumable in small time spurts - there is not a sufficient depth of content to commit to a yearly subscription.

As it stands now the only legitimate use case here is as a refresher on school concepts. Make sure you cancel this after the trial period, or start multiple trial periods with different emails. Otherwise I very much recommend waiting until they update the pricing policy to accommodate the legitimate use case of a monthly subscription model, at least until the volume of content can fulfill a year."
2021,Good app
2021,"It would be great if the app gave options to opt out of data collection, or choose what information was shared.
I will be looking for alternatives now.
Please value our privacy as much as you promote learning.

Khan Academy seems to be a great model for educating without selling your soul to the next bidder."
2021,The app freezes so often it’s literally unusable… please fix.
2021,"I do like what this app, but I often can’t get it to load on my iPad. Closing and reopening will only sometimes will fix the issue. Will update once the developer pushes a fix."
2021,"Can’t even give this app a try without giving up your personal information and creating a user acct. Info grab! Privacy policy says You “volunteer” your info, but you can’t start without doing so. That is “forced”, not volunteering."
2021,"Literally nothing. Who’s leaving these reviews of almost perfect stars? It’s been days! No functionality. Nothing activates when I tap any button. When I click to “join premium” nothing happens. 

Who is having a perfect experience? Because I’m not."
2021,"Love the content, but the app is a piece of crap. Every time I open it, it freezes and content does not load at all. FIX IT For gods sake!!"
2021,There is no left margin. Content begins at edge of screen.
2021,The thing on here says four and up but I cannot registerBecause I’m 12Why would you guys like about this because as a seventh grade you’re trying to learn algebra a lot better you guys are stopping me from learning
2021,I’ve been asking and emailing support for 4 days with no response.
2021,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD if you just want to check this app out!!! The free trial is only for one week and then the app charges your iTunes account $149.99 dollars for a yearly subscription without a paywall or any notification from the app. One email when you download and one when they auto charge for the subscription.

This app should be more clearly labels as a free trial on a subscription at the top of the app page. It doesn’t state that you will start paying immediately after the trial expires in the app info on iTunes. 

This app disguises itself as a free version with in-app purchases. It is not. I was not interested in using the app after trying it and was taken by surprise when the $149.99 charge showed up. 

Not giving clearer intent to charge,with clear timelines, is wrong and seems like a scam."
2021,"Hi there so I go to make an account and it asks me for my password! I’m 9 and I even know not to give strangers my password . Also they want me to give them my email. Otherwise looked like a fun app😛

Well that’s it have a blessed day"
2021,"The only thing brilliant about this app is the marketing. The app is total garbage and not even remotely useful, and the website isnt any better."
2021,Every release I’m more frustrated by their product decisions. Removing any comments in the explanation is the easy choice but it dramatically reduces the value in learning other ways to solve the same problem. There’s zero sense of community within the app anymore. There’s no user journey with brilliant. It’s just a daily “toy”. Wish they would take some product lessons from duolingo.
2021,"Why not a monthly billing option. no way would I pay $150 for an app I might use for a month and then find doesn’t work or isn't connecting with me. I would pay up to $15/ month to try it which is more than the $150 annual. If I like it then people could pay the difference or even $150 for another 12 months.  

If the app is really all it’s supposed to be why not offer this option to those without $150 laying around. 

Yes a 7 day trial but that really isn’t enough time to determine what annual use might be."
2021,"Don’t bother paying $150 for this subscription if you don’t have a computer to use. I really enjoy this product, but I am unceasingly frustrated by the fact that the app never works when I go to use it. I can’t download any courses because the app crashes every time I try. And I’ve lost track of all the bugs that plague the apps interface and functionality. 

I hope they fix it soon."
2021,"The developers  showed several give feedback dialogs … very annoying. I just want to use the application. 
Stop waiting my time.

As you want feedback. Here it is."
2021,App doesnt work anymore
2021,"Tried it last year using the free week trial… swore I cancelled it in time, but then I still ended up getting charged the full $120 for a year subscription. I emailed the support team requesting a refund as soon as I noticed, and they refused. I was angry, but got over it, and canceled my subscription again, for sure this time…. Now two days ago I get charged another $120. I’ve used the app a total of 2 times I believe."
2021,This is not more fun than my other games and it has very hard questions please agree to my question.
2021,"I let my son try this to help with math and science. He used the free version for a while, but maxed out the free courses. I decided to go ahead and subscribe when I saw a coupon code for 20% off. I don’t like the forced year subscription, but it seemed valuable to my kid, so I decided to give it a year. Started the free trial and he really liked the content. My other son wanted to try too, so I thought we’d go for a family plan for the three of us- first they won’t honor the coupon for group accounts- frustrating but the price of 3 is less than three individuals at 20% off - fine. Tried to upgrade my purchase to the group subscription, nope, you can’t add users to make the group and if you make the group, you can’t have one of the accounts be an existing premium member- seriously!? You have to cancel the existing account (only an option during the free trial which luckily I still was) but once it’s canceled you can’t purchase the group account until the free trial would have been over. So thankfully they gave me all this time to re-think my purchase, read a few reviews and see that their support is still terrible after paying, content is limited so the value doesn’t last the year and change my mind about giving them my money. I hate to disappoint my kids, but this seems like a terrible company."
2021,"I absolutely all of the learning that I’ve been doing with this app over the last year.

However the latest version of the app has used the sound API in such a way that it pauses apple podcasts and Apple Music, so that I essentially can’t put on some music or news in the background and work problems.  

This wasn’t a problem until the last few weeks.  

I would rate this app Five stars easy if it wasn’t for this."
2021,I’ve been canceling my account since September and I’m still getting charged every month.
2021,All it says when I try to login is “your registration couldn’t be completed at this time”
2021,"I have been using brilliant on my computer for a year or so. It helps, but when I downloaded the app, I accidentally used my old email (auto-confirm) to make the account. Now, because I’m not a “premium” user, I can’t access the profile and other features to even change the account to my normal one. No puzzles, no help. Seems like they’re trying to rip you off. Lame."
2021,There were so many grammatical errors just in the couple of puzzles I tried to do I got frustrated. In one puzzle Watson was supposed to say that Sherlock was lying based off the explanation of the puzzle. But Watson clearly stated his light was off. Not thatSherlock’s was off. There aren’t enough examples to work through to help reinforce the topic you’re learning. I expected more for something that costs $150/yr.
2021,"By itself, the app’s okay. It doesn’t do a great job at teaching but it’s not the worst. It might be worth $3 a month as a subscription service. It’s certainly not worth the $30 a month fee, or the comparatively more reasonable, but still absurdly inflated $150 a year price.

It’s just not worth it."
2022,"There is nothing special about this app. I would recommend saving your money and buy some actual online classes that cost a lot less too!

I thought they would have some novel way of teaching information, but they don’t. It’s the same as any other class, but packaged for mobile."
2022,"I’ve emailed their team several times and heard nothing. They have charged me over $75 over the last three months through apple. I’ve sent them several emails about it to no avail.

I love the app but it’s insane that no one is getting back to me. It’s already a really expensive app."
2022,"On a new iPad mini, the python code interface is so glitchy that I can only backspace. Can't edit the code they're asking me to edit. Really disappointing after paying $130 for the year! ...Turns out the website does exactly the same thing. WOW. I can't use this service on a mobile device. Oh, also, when you hit ""run code"" on 2 lines of code, it takes nearly a full minute to load the output. Pretty unacceptable."
2022,I have update iPhone 12 and I cannot drag the items into the example placement. For example the chest problem when the robots are on the airplane
2022,"I used this app for the free trial offered after viewing the advertisement on a popular YouTube Channel I follow called KURZGESAGT “In a nutshell”.
Kurzgesagt allows Brilliant to run ads promoting this app while even offering a discount affiliated promo code. Regardless of a Promo code offered, having a Math/Science degree I decided to give it a fair try hoping it would sharpen my skills during down time. Sadly, I chose to cancel my subscription 1 day prior to the end of my trial because I did not like it, personally.

Secondly, The day after canceling, I learned that my bank card had been ran for MUCH MORE THEN EITHER CURRENT SUBSCRIPTION PRICE LISTED IN THE IOS APP STORE. I was charged $159.93 to be precise; Which doesn’t even make sense being as though they only offer 2 subscriptions & neither cost that amount. The 1st premium subscription option listed Is $24.99 billed monthly & the 2nd premium subscription option is listed as $119.99 billed yearly. So where did $159.93 come from?

Luckily when I contacted both my bank as well as Apple Support on Saturday June 11, 2022, the charge was still pending & my bank was able to reverse the charge & Apple Support took a full report, adding this was not a first. My bank did warn me that depending on company, they “could” try to charge my account again. Today Tuesday(6/14/22) Four days later, I got home to learn that they did charge me again, rerunning my card for $159.93!! Unfortunately, this time it set off a terrible chain reaction while recent authorized purchases were in mid-process, by proxy overdrawing it.

I would say this IS Great interactive tool to help teach kids numerous math/science fundamentals. 

Now I’m stuck with an app I don’t & won’t use. And it cost me much more then what is even advertised, that I could have spent on textbooks for school. Very disheartening. Totally disappointed."
2022,"Let me start by saying that I like a lot of the exercises provided by Brilliant. 

However, there are so many bugs; it’s really hard to continue using this product. 
I completed lessons on the website or app and then later my progress has been reset. This has happened several times. Sometimes, I complete a lesson on the app and it doesn’t even show it’s completed. 

In addition, sometimes on the app, the lesson layout will not be aligned properly making it impossible to  do the lesson.  The website is a better from a user standpoint with the exception of losing my data, but even there I have had minor issues with the alignment of the views."
2022,"Amazing product absolutely horrible app. I use Brilliant regularly on my computer, and I recently found out they also had a mobile app which I was super excited about until I found, much like many of the other reviews here, that it just doesn’t work. For me I can’t even log in and it’s super frustrating since I would love to be able to use this on the go when I have a little time."
2022,"I’m so sorry to write this but it’s true. 

All of these quizzes just assumes there’s prior knowledge and relies a lot on the very slightly interactive modules to do most of the teaching.  I end up having to google how to do most things or ask a friend either way. I know this is supposed to “challenge” you, but it quiet honestly feels like they called it that so they wouldn’t have to teach you at a higher standard.  Online learning is hard to teach but I wouldn’t pay for this again. Honestly really regretting my subscription and would not recommend to anyone. Khan academy is 10X better and free. Very disappointed. 

And don’t even mention how little of courses there are compared to price!!!"
2022,Everyone: please read their privacy policy. They track you after you leave the service? They don’t honor a browser’s Do Not Track request? They may sell your information? That’s a scummy practice on paying customers.
2022,I don’t usually leave reviews but due to the price of this app and the promise implied I’m inclined to do so. I think I love math but I need help in understanding it. Using the Kahn academy with my child I discovered math can be understood by anyone. No one ever taught me what I was actually doing with the numbers. I didn’t understand the language and no one helped translate. Unfortunately this app is not Brilliant. I was so excited to learn more but the app made me feel stupid and confused. It does not break down the math into manageable chunks that I can comprehend.
2022,"I enjoyed the program, but the app will not allow me to sign in using my Facebook which is how I established the account initially. If you want to try that the high premium and commit people for a year subscription, it would be worthwhile to fix so customers do not cancel their trial, like I did.  This is especially frustrating when the support says they know this is an issue but here it is not being fixed."
2022,I paid for this app. When it works it works well and the lessons are clear and informative. However there are multiple bugs both in app and on web. Images which are key related to the questions you’re trying to solve don’t show up. This happened in multiple lessons. Frustrating experience and not cheap!
2022,"1) There hasn’t been any meaningful attempt at adding new content in years. Moreover, many “courses” share the exact same material. Brilliant has a problem with the amount of content they offer. 2) They’ve done away with the open discussion solution forum; all you get is the (often stupid) Brilliant staff solution. 3) The daily challenges, besides being broken (yet another bug to fix), cycle through the same boring repetitions of like ten different types of questions. Again, the app needs new content. 4) Much of the content is really poorly presented. Technical terms are introduced without ever defining them, questions are convoluted, etc. Calling them “courses” adds artificial legitimacy to what are actually just a bunch of multiple choice questions/problems accompanied by tacky, ClipArt-esque illustrations. Fix this crap. And stop charging people who’ve already paid until you get actual new content (not just ‘new courses’ comprised of a mish-mash of content borrowed from old courses)."
2022,"It’s not free, make a pay wall you scam trashes wasted 10 minutes of my life forever."
2022,Why do I waste my time?  Apple is full of it.
2022,I got the annual subscription thinking i would use it more and the courses would be fun. They’re only slightly more fun than just taking a college course except you dont learn NEARLY as much as an actual college course. Have only used it about an hour in the past 3 months. I have to force myself to try to use it. I don’t want to pay for something that’s giving me that vibe. Waste of money. Contacted support team to see if i can get a refund because i know im not going to be trying to use this again in the next year.
2022,"it says premium members get access to all daily challenges, this is not true. please fix and i will happily change to 5 stars"
2022,"Be sure to read the entire privacy data use information they provide here at the download. I didn't. I downloaded the app. Provided all my information including my name, my birthdate, my email, etc. I went to the next screen and was asked to pay approximately one-hundred and forty dollars. There is no back button to erase my data."
2022,"It does not work online. Says “offline”. 

No customer support option. Leads to dead end links.

Will renew without authorization. No refunds, empty link again.

Worst purchase ever. May have to cancel my cc card because of this site. 

Very disappointed. 

Would give negative stars if I could.

AVOID-SCAM"
2022,Terrible way to learn
2022,"I wanted to check this app out and see if I like it. Got a pop up for a 7 day free trial, so I subscribed with the plan of cancelling if I didn’t like it. I was charged $150 for a year subscription right then. No 7 day free trial. I have emailed support for a refund, so hopefully I will get it. Before I saw the receipt in my email from Apple, I tried the app and I don’t even like it. I wouldn’t say it’s bad, its just not for me."
2022,"I learned more about math and number theory from Khan academy in 10 minutes than I did from 2 hours and $80. Don’t take my word for it, waste your money and see for yourself. Donate to a nonprofit. Can’t even explain FOIL in a clear concise way."
2022,"Offers only year long subscription, which is too expensive for a single course I wanted to try."
2022,It looks great but why do you need an account it’s not on the right time?
2022,"Do not try this app as apple and developer have found a way to take $150 from me both claim they understand and would issue a refund but cant both . The only way to get your money back is to dispute the charge with your bank causing Apple to place a hold on your Apple ID, basically you can no longer use your phone or anything else connected with your Apple id so save yourself the back and forth and just skip this App"
2022,Charged me even after I cancelled subscription before the end of the free trial. Literally input my card information and stole money from me.
2022,"They are suppressing the truth! When I attempt to launch a course, the button does not respond and the course does not launch. I paid top dollar for premium subscription and I’m getting ripped off. I tried to write this review two times and have been suppressed. I want a refund. If there are going to be technical problems. Don’t get the app"
2022,When I try to sign in with my account it won’t work it just says “Your registration could not be completed at this time.”
2022,Unresponsive on Drag and Drop. Unable to complete problems due to UI. Otherwise seems like a great app.
2022,The Home Screen doesn’t even load. Useless.
2022,What’s the point of subscription?
2022,"This would be the perfect idle app if it didn’t turn off my music. I’ll probably never use it due specifically to this. Downloaded yesterday and tried to run a few lessons while I listen to podcasts and it refuses to let my podcasts continue. I waste time in several games and they all allow my podcast or music to continue playing, I see no reason for this app to need control of my phones audio especially when I have the sound effects turned off."
2022,"Your program is phenomenal; I mean it. Your approach to business seems a tad counterproductive though. Perhaps add a WAY cheaper alternative to your subscription for middle, high school, and college students seeing as they require it the most. Adults can afford the extra buck and aggregate an offer/compensate by giving unique job/internship/opportunities/coupons. Consider partnering with Khan Academy or take notes from how they were able to “rise to academic stardom.” Understand that this’d be an investment as your acquiring a large net of customers in say five-ish years then when you have a solid customer base jack the prices while adding resource(s) and opportunities to recompénsate. You have the framework for something beautiful. Take it by the horns and see where it goes!  If your at all interested in any of the aforementioned ideas implement them and consider hiring me as an intern ( I need the job exp). Much love, luck and good vibes!! - ET"
2022,I have tried to access my account since March...customer service is non-responsive😠
2022,"I’m a parent. I got this app in hopes that my son could use it. Brilliant does make the claim that it’s also for kids. HOWEVER, the app only bothers to ask me MY name and age, not the name, age, or age group of my kid. The app only has profile info for MYSELF, not the option of adding a kids profile. No options locking-out access in the account settings, for when I install the app on my kids iPad. App greets the user: “Welcome, John! Here are your stats.” My kid can only look at me and say, “Daddy, my name is not John!”"
2022,"Brilliant worked great on my iPad in the past, but now it crashes all the time and only a full restart of the iPad makes the app usable again."
2022,"Course material is interesting, but buttons often just don’t work, which blocks me from advancing. The performance also seems to be slow even though all I’m doing is scrolling down a page of text."
2023,"Wow, what a waist of money! The platform is all about collections of questions, and you try to answer them; it is not interactive - does not tailor the questions according to your progress. For the simple Question/Answer = “Correct!” or “Incorrect” interactivity, you don’t need to subscribe to Brilliant and pay $149.99. You can search the internet find the questions and try to answer them."

And now I created another account and signed up for a free trial AGAIN and 1 hour later the platform signed me out saying “this account is currently inactive.” Ridiculous, I’m taking my money somewhere to a serious educational platform."
