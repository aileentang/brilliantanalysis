year,review
2016,A much better past time when life gives you a few minutes than any free to play app I've tried. The math gets a bit intense at times
2016,It's a great way to challenge your mind. The app is designed in a way that it is easy to use and fun to look at. :)
2016,"Nothing is perfect, but this one is close to that! :)"
2016,I wanna do harder stuff but I have to pay 5 dollars.
2016,"I think this is a great app, but I don't think the value is there to pay for the pro version - I wish it was priced a bit lower. 

Regardless, a great way to stay sharp."
2016,"It is a great brain teaser app to challenge you with logical mathematical and other questions but the gui just seems a lil hard to navigate, but I am just getting in to it"
2017,Decent app.
2017,"Most of the problems stump me, but I love the trying. I believe that most of it is way beyond my head, but I still try."
2017,Tests your intuition and ability to logically work through what you know about the question
2017,"The questions are very stimulating and the discussions that explain the problems are very helpful. However, so topics must be paid for to practice."
2017,Some good puzzles
2017,Very helpful app
2017,There are interesting questions that make you think a little.  It didn't hurt as much as I thought it would.
2017,I‚Äôm really enjoying the free puzzles and great explanations when I get something wrong.  It‚Äôs really easy to learn complex lessons with this app.  I don‚Äôt see myself paying for a subscription but it‚Äôd be nice if you could unlock certain subjects for a fee.  Like paying $2-3 to unlock the physics module etc.
2017,Super fun
2017,"Dynamic opportunities presented in a format that presses me to think outside of my mental boundaries  
The discussion of the solution among users add to the experience."
2017,"It's defiantly a great app to learn the BASICS of math. But you only get one session then your have to pay other wise. Also I've discovered a bug that is causing trouble. First things first I'm going to say, I do have Internet and I AM using it. Now every time I finish one of the begging tests, it will have me refresh and it'll say that I have no internet connection."
2017,Good tool for GRE prep in addition to gre specific  material
2017,A nice app with several great problem sets. Multiple solutions posted by users. Monthly cost is a little high for this service but still tempting.
2017,Gives me something to stretch the brain
2017,"I love the problems that are posted. Lots of pure mathematical fun.

I wish the 100 Day Challenge was accessible from the app. I can only get to it from the web site."
2018,I‚Äôve only spent a half hour on brilliant but i already feel I retained what I learned and that I was engaged most of the time
2018,I really like this app. It is educational and enjoyable. Currently I am using only the free version. I would like to get the subscription but can‚Äôt right now.  A little too expensive for a month to month and don‚Äôt have the funds currently for a yearly subscription.
2018,"The app is great, but I wish the explanations had more to them. Sometimes they solution isn‚Äôt drawn out and the question asks you to imagine an item. I think more learning styles need to be accommodated."
2018,Yeet
2018,Yeah brilliant is pretty üëå shweet y‚Äôknow what I‚Äôm saying chief? Not even gonna lie it‚Äôs pretty Gucci if I‚Äôm being honest.
2018,Really have to work your brain for these tests. Not the easy stuff you usually see that doesn‚Äôt really test your abilities. This one does and then some. Genius level.
2018,"This app is great, other than the fact that you have to pay to unlock all the courses/ options"
2018,"Challenging problems which expand the thought process and increase learning. Great job,"
2018,"For as much as I‚Äôve used it, it‚Äôs been a fun and challenging way to practice mathematics and science. Would recommend to friends and definitely enjoyed using it myself. Only 4 stars, however, because of the premium prices."
2018,The explanations are just as important as the questions.
2018,Thanks for this great app. Helps get the brain going when work gets a little monotonous.
2018,"I subscribed to this service to refresh my memory on some fundamental concepts while also exposing myself to new areas of knowledge. Needless to say, this app is well-designed and flashy. The illustrations and user-interface are intuitive and engaging. However, this app lacks a lot with regards to pedagogy. While the brief lessons allow for quick consumption on-the-go, I think the superficiality of the explanations, examples, and exercises leads to shallow learning. If there were a practice/review tool that utilized a spaced-repetition learning model, I might feel more satisfied with my learning progress. In short, don‚Äôt expect the same learning outcomes from this app as you would from a more intensive course."
2018,"It‚Äôs an amazing app, it needs a lot more biology and chemistry content tho, most of the science content is just physics."
2018,A plus
2018,Great stuff. Could use more free content though.
2018,Good
2018,I have been really impressed with the breadth of categories to choose from. The solution sections have been great for learning new things or knocking the rust off my math and physics skills.
2018,"I love the app, and the idea behind it, I just wish you didn‚Äôt have to pay for the sections. I understand why they did it, but it would be great if it weren‚Äôt."
2018,"It‚Äôs pretty good, but there should be more detailed courses"
2018,Very good
2018,I love this app for practicing math over the summer. It works great and has challenging questions. The one flaw is the amount it costs to pay for a subscription. It‚Äôs outrageously expensive. I would pay for it but definitely not that much. I can still use the free mode anyway and would highly recommend this app.
2018,It's aight.
2018,I think it‚Äôs good but there something missing that I can‚Äôt think of. There is definitely room to improve.
2018,This app always challenges my way of thinking.
2018,"I love this app, and have learned so much on it. I started using brilliant online to learn math and science and bought the membership before I knew they had an app. It really is worth buying and it‚Äôs a great piece of software. As a high schooler, I can say that this app gives you a deeper understanding of the curriculum taught at school. Rather than learning ‚Äúwhat,‚Äù you are tasked with learning ‚Äúwhy.‚Äù You are also free to explore more advanced curriculum than is offered in school.

However, I was trying to take one of their basic physics courses, and very quickly encountered instances where calculus was necessary. I‚Äôm currently taking the calculus course to prepare myself, but it would be great if the courses had prerequisites listed so people didn‚Äôt waste so much time going through the beginning of the courses and wondering why they don‚Äôt understand the material. Listing the level of mathematics used in the course, as well as any prior scientific knowledge one needs to be able to understand the course, would prevent people from sitting and looking at the material, wondering if they missed something. I was really frustrated for a good while because I didn‚Äôt understand the notation and mathematics used in the course. I thought that I was just missing something, or forgot a piece of information. It took me going back through the whole course to realize I wasn‚Äôt loosing my mind and that the material was assumed to be prior knowledge. I‚Äôd really appreciate knowing what prior knowledge is assumed before starting a course. Thank you!"
2018,The best way to learn is by struggling through difficult problems and brilliant has many difficult problems to grog away at.
2018,The brilliant app teaches me a lot. The problem is you need to pay tons of money to unlock most of the courses and quizzes.
2018,"Amazing app for learning and staying sharp on my knowledge. I have a BS in Physics and I really enjoy the weekly problems and ‚Äòcourses‚Äô offered here. They refresh my studies and keep me sharp. Unfortunately the subscription price is high, but the product is great so it is justified. I have not yet signed on for premium but I still might. I would happily pay a one time price of $100 for it, but i am not yet sold to pay annually"
2018,"The everyday physics, classical mechanics, and special relativity courses are great; however, I would love the app even more if it added the realm of quantum physics."
2018,"Brilliant is really great... But they charge too much for me, someone that enjoys an occasional puzzle."
2018,Really neat stuff.
2018,"The activities are fun and require active learning instead of passive learning (active learning is the only learning imo).  The problem is that the content is shallow and does not go beyond what is given in the quizzes.  I‚Äôd recommend asking harder questions that take some time to solve so that the learner thinks more deeply about what they are learning.  With that said, it is a useful experience and I‚Äôd recommend it as a first stop for anyone looking to learn a subject that is covered in the app."
2018,"I am just worried I will get through all the material and have nothing left to learn. But it looks like the creators are continuing to add material, so maybe that will not be an issue."
2018,Enjoyable app for learning about anything! Pretty pictures and explanations. Took off one star because sometimes the solutions to questions need to be more thorough. But generally highly recommend!
2018,Very useful for understanding a different multitude of educational disciplines. I would recommend building in a tree linking topics by beginner to advanced.
2018,The only way to keep challenging me is to give me ever changing ways to understand the fundamentals and advanced concepts to of life. Need more
2018,I like this app
2018,It‚Äôs good for start
2018,I‚Äôve learned a lot!
2018,The cost to use the full app is a lot. The free version still has some great problems though.
2018,I really appreciate it brilliant gives me so many wonderful ideas.
2018,Just installed Brilliant. I am becoming addicted by the minutes ;-)
2018,"I think that some of the solutions are way more confusing than the problem,l"
2018,Fun stuff
2018,It‚Äôs challenging!
2018,Great app to sharpen mind. I only have the trial version and is very fun and intuitive. But the full version is quite expensive for my wallet
2018,Fun!
2018,Great on the pot
2018,"I wish I had this when I was taking physics in college!! Very practical problems with thorough results and walkthroughs. I like how they have the problems sectioned in themes that you can pick based on your interest. 

Download it and enjoy! It‚Äôs an absolute blast!"
2018,Some of the instruction doesn‚Äôt consider how it could be misinterpreted.  Not saying it needs to be simpler but clearer.  Is there a feature that allows one to go back and focus on missed sections and strengthen weak areas?
2018,"Been brushing up on CS fundamentals. I really like the course. Very easy to learn and understand. The illustrations for some of the algorithms, such as insertion sort, really made it easier to grasp the concepts at hand. It would be helpful for a lot more of the taught algorithms. One that comes to mind is the frog hop Fibonacci question in the recursion section. Some sort of illustration would definitely help illustrate how the described problem is a Fibonacci sequence"
2018,Great sight lots of information on quizzes. But do you really learned it‚Äôs pricey! Which seems strange for a .org website?
2018,"I really do enjoy brilliant as I find it teaches a lot of good foundational subjects. However, I would prefer if there were more animated instructional videos with the written descriptions. Most of all, I would really enjoy more subjects such as areospace engineering and mechanical engineering."
2018,Great
2018,"The app offers a vast range of subjects, and gives a good overview of every one. While it may not be best to try and learn from nothing with this app, as a tool to review and catch up in a difficult class it is great."
2018,"I like his app a lot, good for students who want to improve math skills and learn more in general! I don‚Äôt like for some things though you have to have premiumüòê Over a great app"
2018,The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because they charge up to $24 a month for the full featured version. Even $10 a month is too much for an app.
2019,"This app has amazing courses, some of the courses have a better explanation than others. For example, the logic course is amazing and very useful, in the other hand calculus done right needs a little improvement because the way they explain some key concepts are rushed and fussy. However, you will enjoy it and learn from it. I would recommend it to those who are into math, science and want to improve their knowledge on the matters. Don‚Äôt buy if you don‚Äôt have time, I bought the year subscription but I‚Äôve only used it for the time gaps that I have between college terms, so consider time!"
2019,Nice organized. Easy to kill time with.
2019,"I love this app. I‚Äôm doing the logic lessons and they‚Äôre fun. 

A couple issues: sometimes I have to click buttons twice for them to work. Also I find the navigation disorienting sometimes. When I go to ‚Äúshow explanation‚Äù and then hit close I end up somewhere else than I thought I would go. And when I leave the app and come back it‚Äôs hard to find where I left off."
2019,"I was actually thinking about getting an old math book just to keep my brain sharp, when I saw this app. I only take away one star because not all of the written answer solutions are clear yet. Also, some of the questions require pen and paper. I wish there was a scratch paper feature within the app."
2019,Especially now that it‚Äôs available offline
2019,I would want to see more topics like history and philosophy. i think it would make the app much better
2019,"I really enjoyed the mini quizzes, though I didn‚Äôt understand some of the material I still gained a lot of information in some of the explanations. 
My *only* complaints are: try not to be so vague on some founding principles if at the beginning of the course if it says ‚ÄúNot to worry! You‚Äôll learn about it in chapter so and so...‚Äô‚Äô but then don‚Äôt explain the fundamentals if the course is for absolutely beginners? üôÑüôÑüôÑ
Secondly, let us know we have to pay for the course before hand! Please let that be included at least in the introductory section, gave an option to buy the full package. Really took me by surprise, I‚Äôm sure others as well. 
Otherwise I really enjoy the app. I‚Äôm going to buy it only because I have no doubt it would greatly improve my understanding and comprehension of material. Thank you all for developing and writing the content of this app."
2019,"I‚Äôd want to be able to ‚Äúsave‚Äù questions so that I can review them later when I get a chance. The web version has that functionality, but the mobile app doesn‚Äôt."
2019,This is a good review or to learn something new. Keep up the good work.
2019,Great game alternative to other builder type games that isn‚Äôt too complicated and is easy to play.
2019,"As far as Brilliant.org goes, it offers a diverse range of topics to do courses in. The good part about Brilliant.org is that instead of memorizing some formulas which you are probably going to eventually forget, you use intuition to understand the complex parts in these various courses. The only slight criticism I might have is that inside the courses, they only offer quizzes, not articles or lectures to read or listen to, but otherwise it‚Äôs a very good app for learning mathematics, technology, biotechnology, physics, and science."
2019,I do about as well on Brilliant quizzes as I did in High School.
2019,"This app is a very good learning tool, I would recommend it. Only thing, the examples of problem sometimes are hard to understand"
2019,It‚Äôs a good app for high school students
2019,"I really liked the lessons that I did. Sometimes with things like this it is difficult to strike a balance between childishly easy and face desk hard. However this kept me engaged and I was able to learn to think through the problems for myself. However to me it is not worth paying $120 a year, especially as this is just a thing I do in a five minute break. I would rather do Khan Academy for five minutes and that‚Äôs also free. I would definitely use this app if there was a full version driven by ad revenue that didn‚Äôt require payment. Ads are annoying to most people but I don‚Äôt mind if the product provides value to my life."
2019,"It‚Äôs really worth downloading!!! So many subjects, explanations, information, and more!!! Best app for smart people and nerdsü§ì (not that nerds are bad. It‚Äôs actually üòé being one!!!). The only 2 things that I would like added and changed is something about biology and have all subjects being usable. But that will never happen because I know app makers need money. Really worth downloading!!! I‚Äôm 11 years old and it‚Äôs summer vacation right now. If you‚Äôre a nerd like me and enjoy learning about cool, new stuff, then download this app and spend a part of the day getting ready for middle school and learning new stuff!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è this app!!!"
2019,"I would definitely recommend this app (great job on the appearance of the app by the way. I like how simple it is.), because I love this style of learning. I have been using it for a few weeks now to understand Algebra concepts better, and it‚Äôs been working pretty well. I love how fun and interactive the quizzes are, and I love how you can just jump around and look at a whole load of different subjects without having to level up or something too. Now, I have given this review 4 stars though, because I find some of the explanations too complicated or lacking in clarity. Overall though, it‚Äôs a great learning tool, but for some of the subjects I feel it‚Äôs better to learn it the old fashioned way and then use Brilliant to really clarify your understanding and anchor down your skills once and for all!!!"
2019,The app is absolutely amazing but I wish i could just buy premium for a price and be good instead of having to keep paying for this every month.
2019,I‚Äôve only been using the app a couple days. The content is good and it appears there is a lot of free content. The monthly subscription is very expensive. That leaves me with mixed feelings.
2019,"I personally am more fond of listening to lectures than reading a lesson on my own, and because of this I sometimes can find myself mindlessly grazing over a lesson without truly learning it (yeah yeah, I‚Äôm in a minority I get it)... But unfortunately, for the week or so I‚Äôve had the app I haven‚Äôt found a lesson which has an auditory option or something that fashion. I fully understand how insignificant this problem may seem, but with a $100 annual payment I would expect my money to be going to a learning platform which can cater to my specific learning style, perhaps with a 10 minute in-depth explanation on a topic or even a whole lesson if I my attention is divided (for example if I wanted to listen to a lesson on my way to work).
 Other than this minor problem I‚Äôve experienced with the app, I have enjoyed the engaging lessons and in-depth explanations. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone, especially if the visual examples and written lessons are the way you personally prefer to learn. Although for those of us who prefer an auditory method of learning it can be difficult to fully take in the information in an easily digestible way. 4/5, needs more lessons in my opinion (more are coming so it‚Äôs not a terrible problem) and a way to keep learners of all styles engaged in every lesson. Great app :)"
2019,downloaded it and i thought it was going to be normal but it actually exceeded my expectations. if your thinking about downloading for high school or whatever like legit do it. we all know this review is voluntary - download it.
2019,Love the puzzles and the ability to discuss and ask questions afterwards
2019,I CAN‚ÄôT WRITE A REVIEW. I‚Äôm new!!!
2019,Mostly great.  Some questions had insufficient information which made the answers tougher.  Great
2019,It is very good now ...as it gets more adaptive it will even be better
2019,Please add a dark theme so it won‚Äôt scald my eyes.
2019,The problems are challenging but accompanied by nice explanations.
2019,It's so nice and good app
2019,"The product is solid quality, but I believe the price is excessive because much of what Brilliant has to offer can be found for free online. The value-added is just in the comprehensive organization, but there are still many topics left uncovered. If they were to double the number of topical modules, a price of ~$25 per month may be justified. However, in its current state I feel that is excessive."
2019,The only reason it‚Äôs not 5/5 is i wish you could do more courses without paying
2019,Wish more of it was free
2019,"The challenges are great and they are a lot of fun, but some of the lessons are a bit wanting. I wish the instruction was more thorough. I admit that I‚Äôm a bit daft. Still, a very worthwhile app."
2019,It should give like little lessons and if you miss a question you had to answer another to go to the next bar
2019,My only request is that you can be able to have a save feature I will change the review to five stars if that happens
2019,"The app presents some interesting scenarios and problems that I would not have encountered otherwise. I‚Äôd like to see a physical book of these problems at some point, a la Logitica (If you enjoy this app, check that out for some more puzzles and problems). While the app is good, and I may well be in the minority, I think I retain information better when it doesn‚Äôt come from a phone."
2019,Overall Brilliant has great lessons and incredible value. Sometimes there are issues with things being unclear and needing better interactions or animations.
2019,"Been using to practice logic tests as regular  brain workout in a matter of speaking; to help with my attention to details.

Working in finance I wanted to brush up on my calculus and differential equations. Soon realized I‚Äôm going to need to go back and take early courses that I did in college just to jog my memory to understand differential equations

Overall it seems good. I would like an audio component not just reading. To accommodate the small minority of people, who‚Äôs auditory memory retention is greater than visual"
2019,"Great app. I love it, but after a while you have to pay for a membership and I just don‚Äôt have extra money to spend. But it is a great way to learn things"
2019,"Great app, displays creativity but expensive"
2019,"I‚Äôve been using Brilliant for exactly a year now, and have solved more than 8000 problems by now. Brilliant really changed the way I learn math, and many courses are particularly well-written. I also like that they‚Äôre supporting many science YouTubers. However, I sometimes complain that the CS courses here are relatively shallow, and new courses have been slow to develop (the advanced algorithms course and the Python course, for example). Also, the app seems to take up a lot of memory on my phone and occasionally causes it to black out."
2019,"Just checking out the app so far, ever wanna ‚Äútwerk‚Äù the mind a little, get the app!   Lol
Premium seems a little costly, but without premium so far has been intriguing, and the app is not constantly bombarding you with advertisements and plugs for primium. Very pleasant and at your own pace puzzles!  Thanks Brilliant team, doing good stuff, keep it up!"
2019,Great
2019,"The only problem that I have is with the latest update, the daily problems don‚Äôt show properly specially with the tables. I hope you guys fix it soon this amazing app"
2019,It helps you learn math and other skills.
2019,I‚Äôm currently in the free trial. I have several apps similar to this. This is an expensive app but it seems well coded and logical so far. I‚Äôd give 5 stars if it was less expensive.
2019,"As a college student, there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm going to be able to afford the payment plans."
2019,Most of the Astronomy classes r locked.
2019,Some sections are difficult for a layman but others are educational and fun. Well put together.
2019,"The brilliant app is great except it‚Äôs missing one key feature. If they added Apple Pencil support so you could write on the screen it would be soo much easier than having to use split screen and notes. Other than that, this app is amazing!"
2019,This app brings topics that I didn‚Äôt even know about let alone think about
2019,See above...
2019,I love this app. I can learn anywhere I go.
2019,I like it but I wish there was a built in calculator or more reading support for dyslexics.
2019,This is a wonderful app and learning site but I wish they had more examples that I cloud understand. Other wise great app. 4 star ü§©
2019,I am going to make a review of the app for my college mates. Could you please give me a subscription for free? It‚Äôs my birthday today. Thank you!
2020,"I‚Äôd give it 5 stars, but it forced me to leave a review."
2020,"Nothing against mobile games, I have played a LOT of them over the years. I‚Äôve recently switched to ‚Äúgames‚Äù that provide more mental exercises. Brilliant does a great job of teasing you with problem solving concepts through puzzles. I can‚Äôt seem to bring myself to go premium due to the high price tag and knowing that I cannot get my monies worth without being on the app more frequently. So, the daily free puzzles will do for now. Also, I‚Äôd like to think of myself as a self starter, and if I‚Äôm truly going to invest in learning a topic, I wouldn‚Äôt rely on on app to get me along. So, this to reduces the likelihood that a premium membership is worth the price to me. This is just my opinion, as I do appreciate the work and effort that goes into this service, and would likely go premium if it were less expensive."
2020,"I love the concept and this is my second year subscribing. My biggest complaint is that unlike other learning apps (e.g. Duolingo), there is no consequence for not opening the app...ever.

I would love the Brilliant team to implement some system such that I feel motivated to progress in my lesson, daily. There is a reminder mechanism for the daily puzzles, but I don‚Äôt pay for the daily puzzles and actually want to follow and be held accountable to a curriculum."
2020,Fun and challenging
2020,"I threw an twist when doing the Fibonacci one where I added all the terms up to the term that I‚Äôm adding. That why my answer is the 18th, because I was adding up all terms until a term."
2020,I like the exercises but I wish they would teach better before doing them.
2020,L
2020,"Love the content, some of the best curation, design, and pedagogy of all educational platforms of all time, however, I believe all educational platforms should be non profits, and still pay their employees very well to continue producing this high level content, but not try to gate learners behind a huge price tag that many potential future engineers and scientists could never afford."
2020,"I‚Äôm really enjoying the free content, especially since it‚Äôs ad free as well. But I won‚Äôt be paying $120.00 a year for this app. If they brought the price down or offered a monthly plan I‚Äôd probably pay then, but a lump sum like that is just too much."
2020,"i have so much fun with this app, but i can‚Äôt afford the subscription! if the price was more like $60/yr i would definitely buy.
also, i get that the app is mostly STEM-centered but just saying i study philosophy, politics, and economics and would LOVE to get some lessons in those subjects in the fun format of this app"
2020,"Wonderfully designed app with wonderfully designed lessons. Still, $25/month subscription model just seems so steep! I hope they‚Äôll change their subscription model to include a $10 a month plan to lower the pay wall for most who can‚Äôt make it over on the current model.

Frankly, although it‚Äôs a great product, who except white collar professionals at minimum can afford to pay into the current model? I hope you‚Äôll take a model more friendly to the people."
2020,Nice App
2020,"Aside from the odd poorly-worded question, is an excellent learning tool; I passed a class thanks to this app."
2020,I really love this app because it has so many fun puzzles with a lot of diversity. The daily challenges are so much fun to do and in my mind the best ones are the logic problems. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. I would put five stars for this any day but the free version of this app has only a little bit of content and personally I think the content is a little too hard for me to learn too much.
2020,"During my free trial, I decided Brilliant was not for me. Unfortunately, I missed canceling my trial by an hour and was charged a whopping $119 for a year membership.

I left a review explaining why I was upset, the support team responded, we emailed each other, and they have decided to issue a refund.

I initially gave a 1 star review because of having such a large surprise amount charged to my account (a surprise because I thought I would be charged for a single month, not a full year at the end of the trial if I were to not cancel in time).

Because the support team responded quickly and professionally, I am happy to raise my review to 4 stars, because I do think the world could use more math and science! I however find the payment/free-trial method a bit controversial. So until they decide to change their model, I can‚Äôt feel comfortable leaving any higher of a review.

My recommendation to Brilliant is to give people a 7 day trial without charging the payment automatically upon completion. Send out a reminder message that the trial is ending. Maybe consider giving a discounted price if they purchase during a free trial. Let the user feel in control of their decision!

Thank you for understanding, and giving me a refund. I do appreciate that very much and wish you all well! Best!"
2020,This is AMAZING!!!! Only thing I say is this is mainly recommended for high school and older.
2020,"I like how concepts are interactive, it provides a more hands on approach to learning and taking advantage of technology"
2020,It‚Äôs a great app and I only wish they had more categories and subjects.
2020,Very informative
2020,"I thought I‚Äôd just play with this for a week for the free trial but I am genuinely considering subscribing. The puzzles are great (although somewhat familiar to anyone who enjoys recreational mathematics) and the progressive difficulty is well planned. 
What would be nice is a scratch pad, or to be able to write on the page. (I‚Äôm using an iPad.)"
2020,"There are some lovely simple animations, sliders for limited movement and elegant transformations. That can be entrancing."
2020,I‚Äôm still in the exploratory phase with this app to see if it‚Äôs actually worth $150. It seems kind of high but when it comes to growth through self education it‚Äôs priceless. I will continue exploring and provide an update once I have drawn my conclusion.
2020,Could have link some explainer videos though- maybe collab with KhanAcademy?
2020,Fun when I can log in
2020,"These courses are very helpful.  That said, the usefulness of the app (and even its fuller-featured web version) would be greatly improved with a few added features.  In particular, I often find myself wishing I had the ability to ‚Äúbookmark‚Äù or difficult problems in a quiz so that I could easily track which concepts I need to work on and return to them at a later date.  This could go hand-in-hand with an improved dashboard page that gave a more granular view of my progress through the various courses.  A highlighting feature would be nice as well.
Beyond that, I‚Äôve been quite happy with the app."
2020,"Upsides : the future of education
Downsides : this is a great way for big data inc. to mark down if you are an idiot or not. And since it‚Äôs free guess who is keeping the lights on at brilliant.org."
2020,Brilliant is one of my favorite apps to go to if I want to learn something new. My favorite courses are the Logic and Logic 2. Brilliant offers thorough lessons and courses on anything you want to learn. The only reason it is not 5 stars is because of minor bugs and how expensive the premium version is.
2020,"I‚Äôve been playing for 2 days now and I like the challenges so far. It will keep me busy and exercise my brain for a while. The explanations are helpful and I wish this tool was around when I was in school. My only issue is when I was finished with a few puzzles I put my phone away and later when I went to continue where I left off the puzzles were there with my answers in place yet didn‚Äôt seem to register. I tried to continue but it wouldn‚Äôt let me. I clicked explain and it counted the puzzle as unsolved, ugh. There goes a perfect score on this challenge. Overall I‚Äôm happy with the game/tool."
2020,"Well, I like a good challenge, and this is proving to be a big one for me. But I‚Äôm keeping at it if it kills me!"
2020,"I love all the quizzes and courses to take, but I feel like it is missing some science courses on biology as well. There is one course of ‚ÄòComputational Biology‚Äô however it‚Äôd be wonderful to have a more in depth courses about other parts of it as well.

Also statistics on your own progress don‚Äôt seem to be as obvious until you manually go to your profile settings‚Äîrather than your results instantly popping up after a quiz.

But overall, I‚Äôm really enjoying Brilliant with all its features in premium!"
2020,"I don‚Äôt know about using brilliant on my phone or laptop but interacting with the brilliant app is quite uncomfortable when using split screen. Whenever I‚Äôm browsing the course library on landscape mode or portrait mode and select a course to preview, the course overview and course sections vertically split the available screen real estate. It produces a very unflattering squished layout in which reading the course overview or seeing the various sections of each ‚Äúchapter‚Äù is an uncomfortable experience. I don‚Äôt need to continue seeing course overview after I‚Äôve read it once. I believe the course overview and course chapters shouldn‚Äôt be split and instead should be static at the top of the page in order to use the whole page real estate to comfortable horizontally scroll throughout the chapter sections (Think of the Netflix app for example, the main show they‚Äôre promoting at the top and different shows are scrollable horizontally, it would be quite annoying if we had to forcibly see the show they‚Äôre promoting everywhere as we continue scrolling down/ up while browsing).

Other than that brilliant is amazing, I would just like it to be more split screen friendly on mobile devices."
2020,"I‚Äôm in 5th grade and this app is amazing, I mean I‚Äôm learning how to code! The only problem is that most things are locked, like I love logic puzzles but it only let me do 3 levels of it. If you have interest in math, science, and technology this app is for you."
2020,Incredible variety of Topics
2020,"Well, nothing else to say."
2020,"I like to start my mornings with a challenge. The UI is very simplistic and clean, takes away any distraction and solely focused on the problem. The aesthetics is very pleasing which makes it fun to learn."
2020,It has cool puzzles and provides many different courses
2020,The lessons are usually interesting and the games are fun!
2020,One bug that I‚Äôve found is that I have two courses that have been completed but don‚Äôt have the green check mark. I‚Äôve tried redoing the last lesson but nothing seems to make them ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù. Help!
2020,"I have just downloaded this app and started using it today and it‚Äôs good but the app keeps on crashing, there‚Äôs no update, I changed my WiFi connection twice yet this problem keeps on happening. How can I fix this issue cause I‚Äôm really interested ?!"
2020,Haven‚Äôt experienced everything the app has to offer so I would be ill advised to give a 5 star as of now.
2020,"However, ease of learning and interactivity are only half I of what I‚Äôm looking for in an educational app. If Brilliant really beefed out its educational game offerings and number of subjects to learn and depth of those subjects, then I won‚Äôt hesitate to renew in 8 months. -Adult Learner/Higher Ed Learner"
2020,The program seems to stay just in front of my rusty memory.  Learning new things and recalling all the stuff from so long ago is a lot of fun!
2020,"I love the education on this app. Some topics are great for me just for general learning and others are great to help my 10 year old daughter understand concepts in ways that weren‚Äôt taught in school. 

I honor their business model and appreciate the value. Buuuuuuut, it‚Äôs really expensive. I keep waiting for a 50% off sale and the I‚Äôd buy the annual pass. @Brilliant - don‚Äôt keep me waiting, please!"
2020,"After just a week of using brilliant, I started getting 100 percents in alll my tests, but the only issue is the subscription cancellation"
2020,"The app isn‚Äôt the multimedia learning tool that is the free web version of khan, 3blue1brown Wikipedia etc. but it is getting better and combines enough for the 100 dollar subscription"
2020,Cool app
2020,Love it!
2020,Brilliant is one of my favorite apps. The content is amazing and the daily challenges are fun and always intriguing. The only issue i have with it is the price which is a little on the high side.
2020,"I was happy to download the app but was unable to use it due to having to register with Facebook, google or your email. I personally don‚Äôt like having to register in the manner that is requested but after speaking with the developers, they explained that this registration is necessary in order to protect against piracy issues. I understand where they are coming from and if you don‚Äôt mind registering, then perhaps this app can be an excellent study resource. I gave it a 4 star review only because I did not get to use it and I do not want to register, however I am sure the app itself is great and might be worth the 5 stars. Good luck!"
2020,I use it daily for self enrichment: however it‚Äôs recently stopped working on both my phone and iPad.
2020,"It‚Äôs excellent except courses should probably have video lectures!
Thank you for all your efforts to bring us this cool app!!"
2020,"A smart game to challenge your mind. A great and convenient prep for standardized tests. However, you can only play the introduction of each course. You must pay a monthly fee for the whole app."
2020,I know they deserve to be paid.... I just don‚Äôt wanna do it üò≠üò≠
2020,I like it.
2020,Thank you Brilliant Developers! Hugs to you!!!
2020,"It is speculated by scientists that math is the ‚Äúlanguage‚Äù of the universe. I am intrigued by outer space, how infinite it is.
I recently viewed a infomercial on a scientist who studies snow. They showed snowflakes, and how no two are alike. The
other side of the coin has to deal with outer
space, in particular intelligent extraterrestrial life. 
Here‚Äôs my observation: I watched a segment on Crop circles and how they may be a form of communication, by there geometric angles, and so forth, and I when I saw the snow study some of the flakes resembled the crop circles. Coincidence? or more communication? Something to think about.."
2020,"A little expensive I think, but this is an app I have been looking for for a long time."
2020,Fun and addictive learning app.
2020,Learned a lot !
2020,Good
2020,Not used it enough yet to really take it all in but I like what I have done so far
2020,"Goes in depth, gives every-day life examples. Expands your thinking. Already like it and I just started using it."
2020,It‚Äôs nice to see software geared towards thinking instead of killing. I only wish there was a middle ground between the free content and the subscription. I wouldn‚Äôt pay that much for productivity software. I certainly won‚Äôt for entertainment.
2020,üïØüôèüèº
2021,It‚Äôs a lot of money for a student.
2021,"I love learning, so the drive for my curiosity to be quenched is awesome. I recommend‚Äî I‚Äôm probably going to end up buying the premium one because I enjoy learning so much."
2021,"This is an Interesting App, but the explanations should be more informative."
2021,"Hey, could you please introduce a dark mode? I think that is one feature that is missing from Brilliant. Thanks."
2021,I think my iq dropped but in a good way üòÅ
2021,"It‚Äôs all there in the title. Just an incredibly well-assembled, beautiful, lucid intro to various STEMmy concepts‚Ä¶ but not one the layperson can comfortably afford at $25/month. Khan Academy and other free resources maybe messed up the market, alas.

Also sometimes the sliders, interactives, etc., don‚Äôt work on a late-model, newish iPhone."
2021,It‚Äôs a great resource for getting started with the basics of math and science.
2021,It‚Äôs unfortunate we have to put a pay gate in front of knowledge.
2021,Super
2021,"Really like what Brilliant is doing and love their interactive content.

Sadly the app crashes often and my streak is stuck at 0. Finishing a course also crashes the app."
2021,"This app allows me to learn things that were previously really hard, although the membership is extremely expensive."
2021,Helpful for upcoming freshmans
2021,"Let‚Äôs not pretend that this is college level training. Yes you can learn a great deal from these courses but it‚Äôs not going to make you an engineer.

I am starting out with the courses on Machine Learning. Good stuff! But there a lot to be desired with visualization and comparative contrasts between similar methodologies, which would really help with understanding the material. Text just doesn‚Äôt convey understanding.

I bought a whole year and I look forward to replacing my gaming with useful learning instead!"
2021,"Things with sliders want to slide to the next page, leaving interaction with the slider and the page itself non-discrete."
2021,Good app
2021,I haven‚Äôt been able to use it for very long but I‚Äôm already enjoying learning new concepts and strengthening my understanding on old.
2021,"I‚Äôve only done a few lessons with the free version. It‚Äôs pretty basic stuff so far, but I love doing the quizzes rather than scrolling through social media"
2021,"I really like the lessons and I think they fit the phone or a small tablet really well but are a little more clunky on a larger display.

But all the lessons are great and the daily challenges are a nice activity to do every day"
2021,Informative and educational... the words are simple to understand and their is an explanation to everything
2021,Really great platform
2021,"I found this app through instagram marketing (as i‚Äôm sure many of you did as well). It ended up living up to most of the hype. The topics are broad and relevant. The quizzes are quick and simple, yet effective and brain-teasing. For anyone who likes learning, this is a great app, and for those who love a visual element to their learning, look nowhere else.

‚ÄôBut sir, you only gave it four stars,‚Äô you say? (Brilliant developers, I hope you are reading these) It could be significantly better if there were scoring, points accumulation, a social element, rewards, or other features to make it more fun and engaging. Especially at this price point. That said, I‚Äôm enjoying the platform and look forward to future versions."
2021,Down side. The app is unusable at Times on my 2020 iPad Pro 11. It freezes or thinks I‚Äôm in offline mode.
2021,Love it
2021,"If you want to acquire some extra knowledge in your spare time this app is great. I think it‚Äôs important to always pursue knowledge, and this makes it approachable. I think education should begin at the end of schooling, not end; and this app allows me to continue educating myself without a time investment. 

Great for learning on breaks at work, on the toilet, waiting in line, or any other time where you might otherwise be losing your time without benefit."
2021,Getting problems correct makes you want to do more. I wish I had more time to dive in. I wanted to use with tutoring Math for more advanced students but you can‚Äôt get to some of the practice exercises until you‚Äôve completed prior lessons.
2021,"Great app as far as the learning and problems go, but it freezes on me far too much on my iPhone and iPad. Please refine the app for less freezing."
2021,This app is phenomenal. I won‚Äôt pay for the subscription until they include dark mode for those who cannot tolerate bright screens. Only then will I fully commit to this app. But the free version is great.
2021,It‚Äôs hard for me a little bit
2021,Nice mix of courses to keep your mind active‚Ä¶
2021,As someone who hasn‚Äôt participated in academic studies for 10 years. This app is improving my arithmetic immensely. My only irritation is that the explanations are a bit wordy for me personally. I‚Äôm sure they attempted to simplify as much as possible but my brain over complicates üòÇ
2021,"TL;DR Brilliant, if you see this, please please please include the community wiki on mobile. If it weren‚Äôt for this I‚Äôd give it 5 stars. 

No joke, if they made EACH wiki topic downloadable for offline mobile use, I‚Äôd pay another $10/month.

It‚Äôs an incredible feature that plays a huge role in my continued premium subscription. For those who don‚Äôt know where it is, it‚Äôs the last section on each topic under the practice tab for desktop.

I really wish this was on mobile since I‚Äôm paying for premium. It‚Äôs very doable too since each page is just text/images, not intensive graphics. 

With phone storage increasing over the years I don‚Äôt think an 8 gig download would be unreasonable. iPhone 13 starts at 128gig storage‚Ä¶

Besides this the app is great! I love brilliant and commend them for making difficult topics easier to tackle. My generation needs a solid foundation in STEM if we‚Äôre going to solve all these intricate world problems. Thank you brilliant for helping us get there (at our own pace) one step at a time."
2021,"I haven‚Äôt had this app very long, but so far, I‚Äôm really enjoying it. I do plan to go very deep with it and try to push it to its limits.
We‚Äôll see how far I get.
I‚Äôm looking forward to the process.
There is a great deal of material here and it is very well presented.
This is a well-thought-out app. I really like the quality that I see."
2021,Not much else to say.
2021,"I guess I‚Äôm not smart enough to figure out the billing. I am offered a price of 149.00$ annually however, I would prefer monthly billing.  It‚Äôs a good app and there is so much to learn-and I would really like to use it to further my education. As an educator myself I am always look for ways to advance my pedagogy.  I‚Äôm happy to pay for this wonderfully designed and curated app, I am just hesitant to advance a rather hefty sum and agree to a year long commitment.  It‚Äôs probably something I‚Äôm just missing.  I‚Äôll go back and ‚Äúread the syllabus.‚Äù"
2021,It's an expensive subscription making it nos as accesible as it should be
2021,Learning great things but at times it‚Äôs pretty difficult.
2021,Love what I‚Äôm learning
2021,"Thanks for helping to develop a part of my brain that can use some improvement üòè
I think though that there are some errors with the names of the androids in the logic section. And sometimes I couldn‚Äôt submit my answer unfortunately."
2022,"I downloaded this app a couple of months ago and started some of the courses just to see what type of content it had. Now the interface looks messy. Other than that, it‚Äôs a pretty good app."
2022,"Love the content, but they recently decided to remove offline content which was one of the great things I loved about brilliant. While this not take away from the content, I do think it takes away from the overall experience."
2022,"This app has excellent graphical representations of mathematical concepts, many of which are interactive. Also, the descriptions are as concise as possible. It‚Äôs a great way to learn core concepts, especially if you are a visual learner or averse to numbers. 

I would like to see more practice problems for each concept, however . I have not played with all the features, but at least with the guided lessons I haven‚Äôt come across problem sets, just one or two examples and then on to the next topic.

Overall, a very good app for what it is. Don‚Äôt expect a complete education from this app though in its current form."
2022,"I really have enjoyed this app so far. I do agree with prior reviews in that this app is designed to reinforce existing skills and not necessarily learn from nothing. I think that the current pricing is high for what is offered. You can finish a lot of it in about 4 weeks if you spend a couple hours each day on lessons. The visuals are nice and the explanations make sense, given I‚Äôve learned these materials before. The pricing within the app description is also no longer accurate."
2022,"I love the app. Great curation, reasonable learning pace, a little too light on reinforcement of the reinforcement of formulas as opposed to concepts but that also really helps with the gamified dopamine rush that makes it easy to swap out a phone game for this.

In the last six month or so, my progress is getting flakier. On iphone, on most loads at the start of the day my course progress is incorrect and I need to do a force close for it to update correctly.

I'm also really disappointed that offline mode is getting removed since it was my favourite activity on a plane trip. I just noticed that Khan Academy offers this feature though so I might give that a shot again and treat this more as a game for when I'm bored"
2022,Good bite sized lessons to do instead of scrolling Instagram. Have used it to refresh my high school calculus. Some bugs in the algorithm courses that I hope will get fixed soon.
2022,I am really enjoying brilliant! It is a great way to gain practical skills in math and science.
2022,"Very good mental exercise!
Thanks!"
2022,"I‚Äôve been using the Brilliant app for a couple of weeks now and I‚Äôm impressed with the range of subjects you can explore, and it‚Äôs use of video in addition to text. I like the fact that there are actual experiments you can perform, and you can run the programs you write. The topics are presented in a way that‚Äôs relatively easy to understand, and there is a logical progression to the information."
2022,Gear app for science and math foundations at all levels
2022,It‚Äôs been a long time since I‚Äôve seen pictures in that course. Please do sth !!!
2022,This app starts with really good basics & I like that it always offers an explanation. Good for sharpening critical thinking.
2022,The math is great but the computer science portions are much too oversimplified with examples that are obvious and questions that are poorly phrased
2022,"In the first few days, I‚Äôve found the app well built. I personally appreciate the interactive visuals, but without actual video. The reason I am giving 4 and not 5 stars is for the accessibility aspects: there is no dark mode, and the text size cannot be adjusted. I have a lot of trouble looking at the bright screen, and have created a script to darken most of the site in the browser version to make it more manageable."
2022,Sometimes it doesn‚Äôt explain each piece to the new equations so that you truly understand what the equation is solving for and what components you might have to find with inferred data.
2022,"The app is functional, if not slightly bare bones. 

Ultimately the design could use some modernization, some ideas would be rounding card corners and adding drop shadows for the courses list on the main page. 

Also the animations (course material and loading) are not running at 120hz on my promotion displays. I suspect the app heavily uses web views but they do a decent job of hiding it besides some of the inherent jankyness that comes from that."
2022,"I love learning with the app, everything is really well written, but for the fundamentals to computer science course, i cannot do it at all on my android phone because the icons don‚Äôt display correctly/"
2022,"I love this app for keeping my brain active on real subjects. 
It could use some technical improvements but overall I love it"
2022,Brilliant has helped me in the education part of my life a lot and I really like to use it I just don‚Äôt like having to pay to do the courses I need to do for school but over all very good app
2022,"This isn‚Äôt rote memorization of formulas. App helps build intuition with stories and conceptual visualization. And the quizzes makes learning fun. 

One downside is that this isn‚Äôt an entire substitute for an undergrad math course. And definitely not a proof based course. But it will get you about 80% of the way there in an enjoyable and efficient manner.

Also remember to have a pen and paper ready even though this is an app. Both to take notes, solve derivations and answer questions.

Overall very happy. Glad I bought the year subscription."
2022,"Pretty solid learning experience. However, I do wish it wasn‚Äôt so laggy on some of the hand on experiences. Most of the time it is fine, but having lag is annoying."
2022,Easy to work through a couple of lessons whilst waiting in line and stuff.
2022,"Love the app, content is good but dear lord please add dark mode. Impossible to read anything right before sleeping."
2022,Hi
2022,Fun and easy way to keep math skills sharp when you have a full time job.
2022,"It‚Äôs pretty good, but when a lesson ends, it‚Äôs stuck on that screen, and there‚Äôs no button to close it. I have to restart the app to get get back to the lesson select menu. But other than that, it‚Äôs greatüëç"
2022,This is better than what I did in real school.
2022,Excellent app with a vast majority of content spanning math for handicapped people to higher level stuff. Everyone should try a course.
2022,Good for learning. Quite expensive though
2022,"Finally tackling maths I should've done years ago, but sometimes the app's explanations for my wrong answers make no sense, or seem wrong.  No doubt it's me but without understanding mistakes it's hard to continue. Is there a forum or some other way to dig deeper when needed?"
2022,That‚Äôs my review
2022,Every time I try to read I can only get a few words or more if I know the reason of it. And am better sure other like me are having the same so all I ask is to get some people to do translation Audible whatever you wanna call it just get some people to help us out the sentences?
2022,"Honestly, all you need to do is add some sounds. It would be even more rewarding when solving a puzzle if there was just something added for getting it right or wrong. Other than that, I love everything else"
2022,.
2022,"Learn a lot, but only get to use one level and then you have to pay $24 a month or $150 a year."
2022,Instead of gaming or watching YouTube I‚Äôm learning! I have a strong science and math background. I wish there was some system that brilliant could use to gauge my skill level and recommend courses. Like a placement test.
2022,TYN
2022,The content is very good but I think it‚Äôs a little expensive.
2022,"I wish Brilliant handled streaks closer to the way Duolingo does. Well the app is very effective at teaching, it could use some work on encouraging / rewarding engagement"
2023,"This is a great app to learn or practice your maths concepts differently. The graphics and interface are great. The only thing I would like the app to improve is the cost of the membership, without it, it's almost nothing that you can do, and with it, you have the benefits to use it at a 100% but as is an app to refine your knowledge it's not something that you're using 24/7."
2023,"The app content deserves 5 stars. But the lack of a dark mode setting is disappointing. Every month that a dark mode isn‚Äôt added to the app, I‚Äôm deducting a star from my review. Thanks"
2023,Pretty Good so far
2023,everything great but sadly exercises are always the same when you restart a lesson. it would be grate to have different set of of them each time you restart a lesson
2023,Love the material but I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs worth the price it‚Äôs being pushed for
2023,"I really enjoy this app. I have always felt insecure about my math skills, but this has helped me greatly, even with just the free courses. I do wish that there was a little more information that wasn‚Äôt behind a paywall. However, this may be the first app that I actually cough up the cash to access fully."
2023,i have only been using for a few days with the free version. fun way to practice old skills but not a lot of options with free version.
2023,"This is a great app for me to learn new skills, but I wish there were more computer science courses."
2023,Good for developing different problem solving frameworks but the some of the explanations aren‚Äôt as intuitive or elegant as they could be.
2023,"Im trying to listen to some of the greatest pieces of classical music ever created but every time i click on continue or a key on the keyboard, my music pauses other than that, great app."
2023,"I‚Äôm Henry, a twelve year old who wanted to learn math and engineering. I enjoy the app but it is sometimes a little bit buggy. As an example, when I try to answer a question but then click out of the question, I have to restart that question. Overall this is a great app but I recommend trying it out before committing to a $120 annual subscription."
2023,"I have been using it for the past 5 or so months I believe. I saw people advertise for it for awhile, some who were even an nasa engineer (mark rober shout out to him). I love the characters and the design for this app, but I feel like there could be a few changes. Personally, I like having notifications because it helps me stay on track a lot. This app does have notifications but they are addressing my league. This helps because I can stay on track with it and continue getting my streak. But that‚Äôs the thing, they don‚Äôt remind you of your streak but just your league. This also doesn‚Äôt help because you have to pay for the app and sometimes I forget and sometimes it feels like I‚Äôm wasting money. Solution for this? Either make a widget or do what Duolingo does to remind you of your streak. All regards though this app is very well devolved and thought out, just more notifications please!"
2023,I want a way to write stuff down in the app
2023,"I want to reset and redo some courses or part of one to test my level of comprehension. This is not possible, I can review the course with my previous answers shown. How do I reset a course fully or partially?"
2023,"I like it so far , it teaches you how to do problems but I had to lie about my age which I tried in till 13 but the app says 4+ so I do t know what was the problem there. So I‚Äôm asking can you fix that problem. Thank you for reading!"
2023,"App is great but what would help would be a widget for Brilliant that displays your current streak number.

Works great with Duolingo and really helps me maintain my daily lessons because it‚Äôs the biggest thing on my Home Screen.

As it is, when I search for Brilliant in the widgets menu comes up. I might even go so far as to try to make my own somehow.

Can I create a dev account or is it the same as a regular user account?"
2023,"The price of this app is too much, but I decided to keep it after the free trial. I‚Äôm currently studying to take the GRE after not being in undergrad for a while and it‚Äôs surprisingly a great supplement to practicing problems."
