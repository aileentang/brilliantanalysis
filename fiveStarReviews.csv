2015,Finally a challenging app that makes me think. Keeps me entertained for ages. ‚ò∫Ô∏èüëåüèΩ A+
2015,Must have for people who like to solve difficult and challenging problems.
2015,If you are just wanting to do some hard work to but that brain of yours to work every day this is the app ^-^
2015,It's a really cool app to brush up on mathematics.
2015,I really like this app. It makes me think and work.
2015,"Brilliant has a wonderful community and this application is wonderful. Sure, a lot of the features are worth money ‚Äî but in my opinion its worth every cent."
2016,"Awesome, thoughtful and engaging. Challenging yet approachable."
2016,fun daily problems
2016,I was looking for an app that would stimulate my mind without it being frustration on social media while also being highly applicable to life and personal. That's this app.
2016,But like this app.
2016,Brilliant is a great way to stay mentally spry
2016,"I'm happy to know this app before 2016 ended. It's definitely the best app of the year. I was very bad and afraid of math when I was a kid. But this app‚Äîomg this brilliant app!‚Äîit reminds me the happiness in math. I cordially hope you guys can keep growing. Great job! 
(Disclaimer: this is not ad s*it. This is my dam* thankfulness from the bottom of my dam* heart.)"
2016,"The quizzes are fun and challenging, and the range of topics is baffling! Really enjoying so far."
2016,The title describes it. Great for any mature teenager to adult.
2016,This is such a cool concept and I feel more intelligent every time I open this app. I would like to see more ads to keep cost down so I can do a one time fee of 1$ instead of a ten dollar fee every month
2016,I really enjoy the promts. They help me improve my solving problem skill :))))))
2016,I rarely give reviews to apps but For this one I am willing to give the best worth 5 stars. I love math and this is something I wanted to play for a while. It reminds me of a lot of the things I learned in school and it is very refreshing. Thanks for creating this app!
2016,Great for higher thinking. Feels good to do some challenging math problems.
2016,"It can go from simple to quite complex very quickly, but I love that it's making me use skills I have used in years."
2016,"This app is a sweet tool for learning and stimulation. 

I'm a nerd/geek/engineer guy. I don't like playing cell phone games; my time is valuable. I don't get to do as interesting math in my job as I did in academia. As a result I've gotten rusty on a lot of the math and thinking skills emphasized in my coursework (complex geometry, logic games, trig, ...). Playing Brilliant gives me a refresher on those skills.

I bought the monthly subscription to this app cause it's a great companion for getting paid to poop."
2016,"-Extremely easy to navigate
-Interesting Topics 
-Great App to pass time with
-Solid information"
2016,This is a great educational app. It explains many things you've wondered about but never knew till now!
2016,It's fun and challenging
2016,The name is very fitting. Love trying this with my students.
2016,I like it.. good if you want different ways to challenge yourself with math problems
2016,This is a very good app for.
2016,It's fyeüî•üî•
2016,Lot of questions for free
2016,Love it
2016,Nice questions and works well
2016,I am very impressed
2016,"This app contains a good number of math and science puzzles. If you like math then you will love this app. If not, then this app is not for you."
2016,It has a great deal of challenging questions and requires my students to think very critically.
2016,"Took advantage of Brilliant.org's most recent email discount.  I enjoy the challenge of even some of their simplest questions because I have discovered that I have forgotten a lot of the mathematics I learned in high school and in the military.  Had one tiny issue with billing, but was treated MOST fairly by Brilliant.org during the short, painless resolution process.  Five Stars from me!!!!"
2016,"I'm twelve so I do tests all the time.  I need to prepare for the tests, and this app helps me in doing so."
2016,Keeps my brain sharp and the math problems are a ton of fun.
2016,"Great, challenging game."
2016,Love the app and I encourage anyone who wants to learn to down load this.
2016,Great app for exercising my poor brain!
2016,Great content! Definitely something I will suggest to my friends and family.
2016,I play every day
2016,I enjoy this game a lot. It's very fun and has challenge
2016,This is exactly the type of app I've been looking for. Great questions for more complex thinkers and younger students.
2016,Challenging and entertaining every time I open it. Definitely better than the other applications I've been wasting my time with.
2016,fun and educational.
2016,Good for reacquainting yourself with old material and just plain problem solving.
2016,"So far I have really enjoyed this app. Informative and useful, and the design is great."
2016,"Overall awesome app, sometimes it's hard to maneuver the app though"
2016,"This app has been helping me make up for all the math I have ever missed or been taught at low standards. It is both recreational and challenging and it helps me to hone a competitive edge at combinatorial and discrete skills that I am weak in. I recommend this to math students, math enthusiasts, and anyone remotely curious who wants to learn and use some really good stuff. 

The only thing I can say is to the one star reviewers: have the humility to check the solution that somebody took the time to write if you get a problem wrong. This app was designed by professionals who may have made a mistake here and there because people are fallible; but that is why there is a feature to report this."
2017,I really like solving its puzzles everyday!
2017,Worth a few minutes of your time every week.
2017,Love it ;)
2017,Very intuitive process of learning. Would recommend.
2017,Personally I like the app. It has me use my brain but doesn't give too many questions at once so I don't get overwhelmed.
2017,Crowd based problem solving is enjoyable to sort through and see the multiple ways to a solution.
2017,Good
2017,"Super enjoyable to use. Definitely missing some content on important topics and the course selection isn't complete yet, but it looks like this should get filled out relatively soon. If they follow the same format, the content should be quite good."
2017,Very cool and accessible
2017,Great quiz question!  Thank you!
2017,This is a great way to expand your knowledge on many important topics
2017,"Its Incredible to come up with an app that helps the memory, not only that but with visual pictures. Helps so much!!! The information is also so simple to understand. Thank you!"
2017,Really nice!
2017,Great app
2017,Is good
2017,Wonderful app to make you think and teaches you strategies.
2017,Could do all these fifty years ago. Want to do them again!
2017,I'm a teacher and I love this. I tell all my students to use it.
2017,... but so far is challenging and interesting.
2017,Just started and I'm really enjoying the stimulation it provides :)
2017,If you‚Äôre interested in how to figure things out you‚Äôll enjoy this app.
2017,Makes you think
2017,"If you are looking to challenge your mind, brush up on topics you haven‚Äôt thought about in a while, or learn something new check Brilliant out.  It‚Äôs great brain food!"
2017,Really great app with good content.
2017,I open this app a few times a day to work on some problems.
2017,Variety of topics to pick from. Problems are arranged in order of approximate difficulty which keeps me engaged.
2017,Actually helped me get excited about learning and growing
2017,This app is as good as the instrumental named pizza!! üëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèº
2017,Good exercise for the brain
2017,"I‚Äôm loving it! It explains it easily, I‚Äôm excited in applying what I learn. Thank you so much!"
2017,"I love doing the challenges. They keep me sharp constantly. I like the discussion sections where everyone explains how it is done too. 

At first I used to answer too quickly and get them wrong. Now I take my time to think them all the way through. And I like that extra push of the brain that I go through."
2017,It's taking up all of my time.
2017,Clearly a thoughtful and fun app for those who love consistent improvement of their cognitive skills. Really well designed and the challenges are pretty fun.
2017,"Such fun. Not too easy, not too hard. The problems aren‚Äôt obvious ‚Äì ‚Äì not to me anyway. The solutions are pleasant. Nice community, an all-around pleasure"
2017,Amazing stimulation to the mind !!!
2017,Guess I was way off
2017,The app really makes you think and keeps your mind sharp.
2017,"I really like the contents, they are very interesting. Also the idea of having weekly problem or challenges is great, making the experience great. High recommend!"
2017,Good problems
2017,Throughly enjoy the question by question format. If I could change anything it would be to make the educational material written in a more user friendly manner instead of in an academic tone as if reading from a college textbook.
2017,Love it!
2017,Have fun
2017,Love this
2017,Great break for a quick mental workout away from the daily demands. Very enjoyable!
2017,So far the only mind sharpening game that I honestly think works
2017,"Usually these kinds of apps/services spoon feed you information, but Brilliant makes you actually use your brain to figure out questions. As a maths major, their wiki pages are pretty in-depth and cover the same topics as some 400 level courses. Major props!"
2017,Everything I was looking for is compiled in this app.
2017,"I bet you'll never find so great couses on the internet. Tough topics simply explained with great illustrations ans examples.

Great for programmers or CS student or just people wanting to study these fields. Highly recommended."
2017,"Even when I can't figure out the answer, I always learn something by looking at the solutions! I'm a HS teacher and have all my students explore Brilliant!"
2017,Do it. It‚Äôs better than re-runs of ‚ÄòFriends.‚Äô
2017,"I like being able to do something meaningful on my phone when I have spare time, for a change!"
2017,My learning momentum is poised to reach escape velocity! üòÉ
2017,"I‚Äôm loving it so far, thanks for the creators!"
2017,Great brain test yo keep you on your toes!
2017,"Learning small amounts at a time. And, this app is a great help with that."
2017,Highly recommended to anyone who needs to develop his mental skills
2017,I wish I'd had this when I was in school.
2017,"The questions are hard, but open your mind up to topics you might not have had exposure to previously. The quiz format is fun because even if you get the answer wrong it challenges you to try harder to improve. I like that the solutions are discussed so you see how others think about it, but it would be helpful if there was a way of highlighting which of the proposed solutions discussed were correct without deterring participation."
2017,"I am a nerd in senior year of high school and loving this. It presents a constant source of problems. Except these problems I enjoy solving, so that's all right."
2017,"Great app, hurts my brain sometimes."
2017,Great app w/o being overboard
2017,"Hello, and I am very pleased with this and the original website. I am in 6th grade and soon to be in 7th. I attended the Academic Games League Of America Nationals tournament not to long ago and was satisfied with my scoring. I still think this app is helping me to improve every day and I very much enjoy it. I am hoping to attend college 1-3 years early but I do not know yet. Once again I would like to say thank you for making this app and that you did a great job on it. If I could I would give this 10 stars."
2017,A truly wonderful surprise and beneficial tool.
2017,"Brilliant is a great way to brush up on old ideas or learn something entirely new. I studied Math in undergrad, so returning to these concepts is fun and refreshing. Beginners will be hooked and experts may be surprised by some of the challenges!"
2017,I'm not as smart as I thought
2017,Excelente idea
2017,"Great app for testing and teaching. Great way to teach based on any level of understanding. Answer; Get it right and move on, or Get It wrong and get an explanation on the answer. 
Great explanations and graphics."
2017,"I am almost 30 and haven't done math or science in years, but this app is making me and my wife excited to do a little everyday."
2017,"So far. I'm only 3 questions in, but it's just like the questions in the web."
2017,Great for developing skills
2017,Having fun and learning.  Taking me back to my university days.
2017,Am enjoying it immensely.
2017,I've been working on getting back into math as part of my professional development but I don't have a lot of time. This app is perfect as long as you want to stick with it a little.
2017,Keeps me entertained. Keeps me sharp.
2017,This app is great to improve your abilities in many educational areas! üëçüèΩ
2017,Great App
2017,Best app ever!!!!
2017,This app is brilliant!!
2017,"Great app, highly recommended!"
2017,This is a good app. I really enjoy the information that it is giving.
2017,Refreshing to see something like this!
2017,I love the progressives quizzes and daily puzzles.  Started using them in my classroom as extra problems for students.
2017,Finally! An app that is challenging AND fun!
2017,This is fun and challenging!
2017,Love this app! Helps me prepare for my competitive exams!!!
2017,It's cool
2017,Great stimulation to think
2017,How great is to have a problem available to solve every time you need a puzzle!
2017,"It has good introductions for all STEM studies and it has really fun math problems. I'm working in the 100 days challenge now, I enjoy it."
2017,Makes complex concepts easy to understand.
2017,"This is an excellent service and concept, whether you're looking to improve your math fundamentals, start learning about math as a complete beginner, or sharpen your already honed quantitative abilities with problems of the highest order. Very excited to see what content is added to an already diverse and exciting base (including everything from Algebra 1 to Machine Learning). A much better way to learn this stuff than videos, regardless of where you're coming from."
2017,"The problems are always interesting, highlighting some curious mathematics. The courses make it easy to work your way up to advanced concepts that might otherwise be difficult to understand. I haven't used the app recently, but I wish you would make the 100 day challenge easier to find in the app."
2017,Great app
2017,Highly recommended.
2017,This is how school should be teaching!
2017,"Great job, I really enjoy the app. Please keep up the good work!"
2017,I am really enjoying the variety of the questions presented.
2017,"My elementary age son and I enjoy going through these problems. Just enough information to make things interesting, with other participants providing more in-depth, mathematical explanations so you can always find something at your level.

We are considering a subscription - will see once school begins."
2017,Challenging
2017,"My teens and I (and occasionally my 9yo when I can think of a way to simplify or make the problem hands-on for him) have been having a blast with Brilliant's 100 Day Summer Challenge. Some we've solved quickly, others have taken some thought, a few we've struggled for days, and a couple we're stymied by but determined to figure out before summer's end! Almost all have engendered discussion about the different ways each of has approached it. We love being able to read how others solved each problem as well."
2017,Lessons are well constructed and the interface is a pleasure to use
2017,Keeps you pondering for hours
2017,This app is fun and a good way for this grandmother to relearn some math from long ago.
2017,Started using this app to refresh my physics knowledge.... great so far.
2017,"Best entertaining app ever!!! Weekly puzzles, physics, math, everything!"
2017,"Shows how much you payed attention in school, if you studied and truly listened and learned it's easy. Keeps the mind sharp."
2017,Love it
2017,I look forward to this short quiz every day.
2017,This is a great app!
2017,üòçüòçüòçüëÅüëÅ
2017,I'm not so great at math and have rarely found textbooks that guided me comfortably though solutions. This app does. My only issue is that I don't have the time to fully utilize the subscription investment.
2017,This app really keeps the brain sharp.
2017,It's great. Helping me to relearn math after years away. Truly good for the brain.
2017,Very good app and I learn a lot from brilliant
2017,"The difficulty for perfectionists is that you cannot take the time to analyze every question in detail or recall all of the physics/math/engineering/chemistry necessary to ensure you have covered all the bases on a given question.  I gave up trying to be perfect and just went to the discussion to learn and relearn those details.  Highly recommended for students with more limited time to budget on a subject.  I also like the opportunity to actually spend some time thinking about problems and solutions.  The only thing I would like improved is the ability to enter the program and go to different sections.  I received a challenge in one subject and entered the software and it took me to the math questions I enjoy.  I could not find a way to get to the challenge that was a physical science problem.  I also so not find a way to save interesting problems/answers that I would like to ""bookmark"" ... especially from the coursework."
2017,"Good practice keeping my math mind sharp, even if I don't get them all correct"
2017,Brilliant way to pass the time and exercise your brains
2017,"Very well made, addicting, feels like brain is growing"
2017,Quick fix for the brain
2017,Amazing way to learn the hard stuff
2017,"Brilliant is a wonderful app that promotes deeper understanding of both simple and complex subjects. 

As a college STEM student, there isn't enough time to spend on fundamentally understanding every concept and learning the practical applications at the same time. Often, more emphasis is put on practical applications, which results in a lack of fundamental understanding later in life as I've experienced. Supplementing a STEM education with Brilliant has been an awesome experience and I always look forward to the weekly challenge problems!"
2018,Great at app for learning and practicing what you've learned
2018,SMD
2018,I have been looking for an app that keeps my intellect on its toes.  This app gives me the same excited feeling I had in my undergrad years as I studied and learned math and physics.  It‚Äôs great to once again work those muscles.  Thank you!
2018,Super fun and stimulating took. When failing to answer correctly- the explanation become so handy. I am getting better:) thanks!
2018,Perfect üëå
2018,Great way to brush up on math and statistics in your free time
2018,Push your mind to the limits!
2018,Great app
2018,Overall great app and better teaching method. I love it
2018,Really a ton of fun and a great way to spend a few minutes or more when you have a lull.
2018,"This is a very helpful way of learning, it makes you use your logic instead of just memorizing formulas. Math feels like fun with this app"
2018,üòÅüòÅüòÅ
2018,Finally getting it!
2018,Great alternative to mindless social media!
2018,The free version makes me want to get the full version! It‚Äôs so fun and you learn/practice concept so well!
2018,I love it
2018,"Better app to make your brain think faster, wherever you are you can use it and optimize time with brilliant things."
2018,I love this!
2018,Thank you! This is helping me in so many ways!
2018,"Lots of free courses that you can take, the way they teach you is better than any school course you‚Äôll ever take. I have no complaints, I would recommend it"
2018,"First three days I answer maybe 10% of questions correctly, now I‚Äôm answering 40%. Working on my skills for about four or five hours a day."
2018,"I started yesterday,this app is very practical,thank you so much!"
2018,"You can learn everything on this app and enjoy the time while you are waiting to n a line, in your car and more.

I recommend this app 100%"
2018,"It‚Äôs a great way to test yourself if you like independent study. It isn‚Äôt free but for people who already go to study groups and have tutors, this app will give you a quick reference tool right on your device."
2018,AXZ
2018,This app really allowed me to learn even without a premium membership. Thank you.
2018,Love the app
2018,Favio5
2018,This app has let me get insights on a subject before actually taking college credit for it !!
2018,"App works well, good substitute for when I‚Äôm not at my computer"
2018,"I want to describe in three words: impactful, clear, brain stimulator"
2018,"It‚Äôs great, I cannot afford the subscription right now, but I‚Äôll definitely get it when I can. I recommend this app!"
2018,Love it!!!
2018,Awesome
2018,I‚Äôm someone with a curiosity level over 9000 and the Courses and Challenges the app offers are great.
2018,Good
2018,This app is very will made
2018,I love this app it has so many lessons and practice. The courses are guided in so much detail and it makes it a fun experience and an enjoyable one. But I feel like the biology course should be expanded a bit and that their should be a chemistry course to. But all the physics and calculus courses are great.
2018,Pretty much a great way to fill time! I love puzzles!
2018,Nice package and use of a right community!
2018,Awesome
2018,It‚Äôs a great app for learning and decoding the information of the universe.
2018,"I‚Äôm enjoying it so far, thank you."
2018,"Nicely done, indeed!"
2018,I feel like these activities are sharpening me up.
2018,This is excellent for anyone. Can‚Äôt find myself to put it down. Great job
2018,Worth the $
2018,I never thought I would enjoy doing math. This app turned the tables.
2018,"I‚Äôd like to preface this by saying I never review apps. Ever. On a whim, I downloaded this app to see what the fuss was all about. I‚Äôve only spent maybe 20 minutes on it so far and I‚Äôm totally blown away. This is some quality educational content in a fantastic format unlike anything I‚Äôve come across before. The material I went through just now was familiar to me from two classes I took in college: a psychology course on memory & cognition and an English course that focused on persuasive writing, mainly logic. Bachelor degree level content here! I‚Äôm truly so impressed and thrilled that this exists. 

I was so ready to jump on the premium train until I saw the payment options. The special price for the subscription to sign up right away is only if you pay for it annually, meaning a pretty big chunk of change all at once for something you haven‚Äôt gotten in the habit of even using yet. The other option is to pay monthly, except the monthly price is three times what the special would be if paid monthly. I know this might not be a problem for most people, but I‚Äôm an enthusiastic student who got sidelined by a sudden illness and subsequent disability that has prevented me from being able to go to school and finish my degree. I‚Äôve been looking for something like this for the past two years to satisfy my hunger to learn without completely exhausting my body. Being on disability, I can‚Äôt front $100 for my subscription, but I can find a way to scrape up $8/month. For those of us who live from week to week, please make this more accessible!!"
2018,Love it!
2018,Really easy and straight forward
2018,Excellent
2018,This app challenges you to apply logic in a fun way.
2018,This program is designed with good content in a clear manner.
2018,Good for daily teaching routine
2018,"Been using this app for about a week, so far so good. I started out not knowing anything about computer algorithms, but now I feel I am well informed about the basics."
2018,"The only con is more content, but that is coming."
2018,The app it great I‚Äôm learning all this new stuff and things
2018,Just downloaded and it‚Äôs kept me busy and interested while keeping my mind going with great puzzles and questions. Highly recommend.
2018,Good
2018,"Amazing game! I am twelve but am so passionate about math and science, yet I had no idea where to look for a trusted place to learn. Brilliant is perfect get the app and go pro, amazing totally worth the money"
2018,Maybe a bit pricey but worth it if u are going to use it.
2018,Great app overall
2018,"Currently accelerated to a general relativity course, and the special relativity allowed me to survive!"
2018,"Great app! Really helpful and nice way to learn.  Greatest app, ever!!!!"
2018,Perfect app .
2018,It keeps you sharp.
2018,Love free stuff!
2018,"This app is great. I recently have started school again after being away for 12 years. I barely remember anything. I got this application and was immediately overwhelmed. After a few hours a lot of things started to click again. Truly amazing. 
Great application. I just wish it wasn‚Äôt so expensive."
2018,Fun app for playing games to sharpen your problem solving. It‚Äôs also a great means of practicing theoretical questions for Computer Science fundamentals.
2018,"I really enjoy the math and love that there‚Äôs a place to practice advanced math and science, this helps me in math competitions and quiz bowl, as well as being fun."
2018,"Brilliant does a nice job of pairing fun, thoughtful questions with your choice of subject. This is not a study guide, but instead a way to refresh or even learn concepts from scratch - all done at your own pace!"
2018,"This app helps you learn more about almost anything you‚Äôre interested in, from astrophysics to logic puzzles it literally has it all."
2018,One of the best app I downloaded so far.
2018,Cool
2018,Best interactive way of learning I‚Äôve come across
2018,I learned about this program through YouTube The person on YouTube was said he wasn't learning anything in school he was renting in raving caught my attention.now I like this program because it emails me to do an activity. The program explains it The way it's set up makes it easier to use
2018,This is a great app to visit to build your skills! Thank you!
2018,Even without the premium you still get a general idea of the subject
2018,Real good.
2018,This game is the real deal. It will challenge you...!!!
2018,Fun!
2018,Brilliant is a wonderful app that you can use if your not getting it and it‚Äôs great for all ages including my 11 year old self enjoys learning algebra please use this to get this amazing app
2018,A fabulous educational app that provides me a true learning experience without a lot of fluff!
2018,Love it! It‚Äôs fun for people like me..
2018,"If you are curious about a math/science subject or need to brush up on the conceptual basics of a subject, Brilliant is great. They teach in a way that is easily digestible in the mind. This app works great, btw."
2018,This app provides a much more productive way to pass time than social media apps. üëç
2018,Love it!
2018,"I love to learn online. However, one problem I have with online learning is that I often do not retain the material and need to solve problems on my own to supplement. This is not the case with Brilliant, as their instruction method of using quizzes keeps me engaged and helps me retain the material much better than the videos and code samples I find on other platforms (such as Udemy). I wholeheartedly recommend the platform more to those looking for the best method to up their knowledge online.  

Thank you!"
2018,Good
2018,This is a great app with lots of cool stuff to learn
2018,Just what one needs to wake up to in the morning.
2018,Very good
2018,‚ù§Ô∏è
2018,Nice and very informative. Challenges your thinking and encourages learning process
2018,Creative ways to learn problem-solving strategies and content! Great exercise for the mind!
2018,"So far this app is educating, entertaining and challenging which is good for users of all ages."
2018,Is groot.
2018,Good summary

2018,I am showing a student your product. She is a Science Olympiads and she is enjoying the various models.
2018,I love science/physics and they have a great section for those.
2018,"High quality content, challenging and fun"
2018,Cool
2018,I much prefer browsing this app to learn the contents of my class rather than sitting through lectore. Smh.
2018,It‚Äôs very entertaining and it builds the concepts gradually. After a few courses you will see a lot of difference in your learning.
2018,Never had so much fun in my life.
2018,Keeps my head sharp
2018,I like
2018,It‚Äôs got some interesting questions/tutorials.

2018,Love this
2018,It wasn‚Äôt until Brilliant that I was able to enjoy learning about math. Brilliant breaks down difficult and abstract concepts and delivers them in a entertaining and easy to understand way.
2018,Moments of boredom have a cure!
2018,"The style of teaching is more of making you think and give answers. In this process I believe it‚Äôs expected that you will find some answers outside of the app by reading external material and sometimes building your own solution on paper or a computer.

This is not a spoon fed approach and I like this approach. Some others might not. Beware."
2018,Truly brilliant
2018,"Helped me learn to code in hours. Great tool to help you study, highly recommend this for all ages!"
2018,I‚Äôm having a great time doing the lessons and learning a ton of practical information.

2018,"Fantastic, easy to use"
2018,Wish I spent more time on this app
2018,This is a great app to challenge the mind. Just what I was looking for. I haven‚Äôt needed to purchase anything yet but that could change my rating if it would become quite costly to look at the different solutions.
2018,Best app i ever seen it is full of info and make science more enjoyable.
2018,I love it but it‚Äôs fairly expensive.
2018,"Used properly and with some textbooks, this can turn any motivated person into an MIT grad."

2018,Great!! Having a good time
2018,Seriously helpful study tool. Will use in the future as a supplement to class work.
2018,Keeps learning fun.
2018,"Now retired from a profession that generally used only basic math, I haven‚Äôt had to utilize higher level mathematical reasoning in many years.  I am absolutely enjoying Brilliant‚Äôs problem-solving quizzes, even though it sometimes takes me a while to figure them out and I make mistakes.  The challenges are fun ‚Äî if a bit frustrating ‚Äî and more gratifying than some mindless activity.  I definitely recommend Brilliant to anyone who wants to keep her/his mind active... especially retirees!"
2018,"Initially i had an issue because i was charged for the entire year thinking it was a month to month payment option. I reached out to apple and they helped me out. Also, represtatives got back to me and explained the cause of the issue. 
The app is amazing and i catch myself on it for hour at times due to the variety of courses. Great app guys. I would love to see interactive functions in the future."

2018,The person who is writing this (not the person who owns the account) is in sixth grade and I'm about to go to seventh and I was denied the advanced class. The regular class is so boring and I really wanted something interesting. That's exactly what I got! And when I get the answer wrong I can see what I did and take notes. Love it!
2018,Excellent learning platform.
2018,It‚Äôs very humbling to see all of the incredibly brilliant people on this app. Makes you realize that you‚Äôre not as smart as you think

2018,"I'm a theoretical physicists. I'm surprised to find a tool for broadening my horizons in fields I'm not familiar. The material is introductory, but not lacking in sophistication. You can learn topics, like group theory, with simple ease. Then transfer to more rigorous materials, like text books. In this way, it is an excellent way to get over the initial barrier to learning an interesting topic."

2018,Ye
2018,Super stimulating and nicely put together
2018,"It has a great interface and challenges you to think. If you can't solve the problem, then you can see how it can be solved. Feel good when you solve a problem and learn something new when you don't."
2018,title says it all baby. shoutout young thug and travis Scott
2018,Great app
2018,"The language of creation which is pure mathematics, gives us a hope to live in a better world.

2018,"I‚Äôm in eighth grade and I‚Äôm pretty new to this, but I‚Äôm trying to learn more complex math and this is really interesting and fun. I hope more kids get and enjoy this, even if it doesn‚Äôt seem to be the type of things normal children would enjoy. There is so much stuff and I‚Äôm exited to get the premium, but take this review with a grain of salt as I‚Äôm sure you can find a better review from someone who does have the premium."
2018,Great app for learning subjects and problem solving skills in the STEM fields
2018,I enjoy Brilliant because of the puzzles it gives you to solve. The skills that it teaches you as well. Great App.

2018,"I hate school but I love learning. I do most of my learning through YouTube and free ebooks. This app is excellent to get the basics down and it also explains concepts when it‚Äôs unclear. I usually do a couple of exercises per day because i like to take things slow. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it taking it on the go. It depends if you can learn like that. Personally, I need to settle down somewhere comfortable and get myself engage with it. Overall I believe this is an excellent app. The free version isn‚Äôt too shabby."
2018,"When I have trouble understanding a concept in class, I use brilliant. I‚Äôm taking Calculus/ Analytical Geometry so this has helped me review what I‚Äôve learned."
2018,The mind games are excellent. Keep up the good work
2018,This app is amazing it has so much stuff to do and really helps the brain
2018,"Brilliant is capable of baffling some of the most meticulous minds out there, but whether it improves your thinking skills and teaches you how to approach problems is controversial, on that note i have not subscribed to the full subscription based of this assumption."
2018,Great so far
2018,Cool app
2018,"Brilliant is a wonderful app for STEM students or any other person with a love for learning. I did not expect such good quality from an app, as many tend to push a subscription in order to have more access. Judging from my consistent use, the creators job have done an excellent job in spreading STEM education and cultivating a love for science.

Can‚Äôt wait to see more!"

2018,This app does a great job at keeping your STEM   thinking skills active. The questions of the day really challenge thoughts and the fact that there‚Äôs a community behind these gives it a more competitive yet friendly feel to it. The mini subjects that you can learn are also very engaging. I thought the premium membership price was too much but once I budgeted to pay for it I thanked myself later. Don‚Äôt sleep on this app if you want to keep exercising your mind!
2018,Love it!
2018,Utilize ruuyotittsutyttytr
2018,"Even though to keep learning, the app recommends you to buy for more lessons. Though it is unfortunate, it is by no means a bad app. It helps you with basically everything."

2018,"I really like this app and I think it‚Äôs a great premise. However, could you make the premium a little less expensive? I‚Äôm a spendthrift (I always take the free option) but for this I‚Äôll gladly spend money if it was a bit cheaper. By the way, developers, if you‚Äôre reading this, how do you post problems on the community page? Thank you!"
2018,Great app !
2018,"As some who struggles a lot with STEM related subjects, especially math, this app so far as been, well, brilliant for helping me to understand, a few steps at a time. Five stars, one of the best apps I've ever had. I don't have the premium version but I'm still getting plenty out of this."

2018,The quizzes are fun and they help you start thinking differently.
2018,"I‚Äôm a high school student who loves to learn. Though I‚Äôve found that my school does not teach everything I want to learn. However, this app does! Even if it‚Äôs not a course, they have wiki pages on just about anything. This app even helps me review for classes at school (and, ironically enough, is way better at explaining things than some of my teachers). Highly recommend!"
2018,It really does
2018,Love it
2018,This is a fun app with lots of challenging problems.  Sometimes it‚Äôs hard to find the time to focus:  this app will help you to dig deep.

Extremely well made. I love puzzles that make you just sit there and THINK. I fell asleep last night by thinking about one of the questions hoping I‚Äôd know it when I woke up. 

For once I think this game can actually make you smarter. Well, not smarter, that‚Äôs not possible, but teach you how to think which is what really matters. 

I never pay for games. I‚Äôd pay for this game. (Maybe I will at some point, haven‚Äôt looking into it)."

2019,"I absolutely love this app. It reignited my passion for math and the world of numbers. It teaches in a wonderful fashion that lets you figure it out at your own speed and learn nonchalantly, as some learning should be. It integrates math and science into my daily routine of social media and texting, hopefully one day replacing the latter two completely! Unfortunately I am heartbroken by the price. I would pay it in a millisecond but I simply am a self sufficient student and I don't have extra funds. Despite this, I would recommend this app to anyone with a burning curiosity pertaining to the wonders of the universe and its intricacies :)"

2019,I enjoy brilliant in my past time keep them busy five stars.

2019,I love learning new things
2019,Simple easy learning tool!!
2019,Enjoying math from high school and then some!
2019,"This is not an end all program you need other sources of information for most of these subjects; however, it does provide an in depth often different point of view to help solidify these topics. While I am still a fairly new user I still highly recommend it."
2019,One way to make it better is to be able to tap on old concepts and get a quick review or summary like Wikipedia‚Äôs website started doing.
2019,"I downloaded this app mainly out of curiosity. I‚Äôm already well versed in quantum mechanics and I was simply curious to see how well they expressed the subject‚Äôs nature and quirks. They explained many subjects with astonishing perspective and accuracy. I can only imagine how well they explain the other courses such as calculus and logic. If you lack a sufficiently competent professor, this app will help you out in a pinch. Even if you‚Äôre already familiar on things like mathematics and physics, there is always something new to learn on this app. The memberships are set at a great price and the visuals pop and express perfectly the matter at hand. I just wish there was an offline version for whenever I‚Äôm on a plane or such. Cheers!"
2019,Simple to use and the puzzles are fun and also educational
2019,Loved the app
2019,Enjoy immensely
2019,For learning
2019,"I love the math and logic games.  I didn‚Äôt have great math training growing up but math intrigued me.  Over the years learned I am a very logical person.  Then I started to improve my math skills with Khan academy etc.  I like to play games very much but certain games like chess or simcity buildit.  Then I opened this app the other day and was blown aways.  The lessons here are soo interesting and mentally stimulating.  It is like going on a mental adventure, readying a mystery novel, and playing an exciting and relaxing games.  I can apply these skills to my life.  My mind feels woke now.  Thank you."

2019,"It is good for both kids and adults. If your kids like it, they can study by themselves. My kids really enjoy it."
2019,I never had great science education growing up (my physics teacher in high school was certain the planets orbited the sun in concentric circles) so 15 years later this has been a lot of fun to pick up.
2019,I love being able to challenge myself intellectually and knowing that more courses are added regularly.
2019,"I‚Äôve already recommended it to several friends and family members. I enjoy learning about these concepts some would claim to difficult to find entertaining. However, it does a great job breaking everything down into small bites of information and explaining them in layman‚Äôs terms. For a free app, this is truly a must have on any device."
2019,"I consider Brilliant one of the best ways to learn math, probability theory, geometry and many other subjects."
2019,"Beautifully created app which engages you in a mentor-student-rival kind of way, love it keep up the good work."
2019,It‚Äôs 10pm. I‚Äôm WANTING to go to class with this app at this hour.  Great and easy to use.  VERY helpful.
2019,There are so many subjects to choose from. The lessons are very well planned and explained with just the right amount of detail. The daily challenges are great. A great app to stay fresh on subjects you know and to expand your knowledge on those you don‚Äôt know much about. So glad I found this app.
2019,It‚Äôs nice to have an app that actually helps learn / revise a wide variety of Math and Science topics! Really enjoying it so far! It‚Äôs an easy to use interface and find that there are no interruptions.
2019,Good
2019,I have been using this app for almost a year and it has been amazing to have math stay in my life and to not lose any talent I have in this field
2019,"Haven‚Äôt always enjoyed these types of subjects but aspired to understand them. The hundreds of games/questions are short, organized and fairly diverse. The solution explanations are consistently simple and clear. I bought the lifetime subscription and can tell I‚Äôm improving by just playing around a few minutes a day waiting for the train. Plus I appreciate the multiple places to give optional feedback in-app; thanks for continuing to improve your product!"
2019,Such a great app for students.
2019,Good
2019,I love this app so much and it only gets better everyday!  I use it everyday and it brings me so much joy!
2019,"These puzzles are amazing! The app starts you off with small, simple exercises and puzzles. But not so diminutive that they‚Äôre boring. Then, you progress to more exciting and intricate puzzles; all the while learning, and immediately exercising what you just learned. And the most awesome part, if you don‚Äôt understand why something is the way it is, there‚Äôs a down to earth explanation - complete with descriptions, pictures, and gifs. You can‚Äôt help but learn, and the fun makes you never want to stop learning. If you are a lifelong learner, you will love this app!!!"
2019,"I love it and everything is very interestingüòÅ
I just wish you didn‚Äôt have to pay money for the premium kind of ridiculous but all the other stuff they have on there is really goodüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüéäüéâ"
2019,Brilliant allows me to study all the courses I want for free and I get to refresh courses I‚Äôve taken in the past. :)
2019,It‚Äôs really good and helps me learn a lot
2019,"This app is great. I use it almost everyday to brush up on my everyday skills; physics, math and astronomy. The free version more than enough to learn new things everyday. I would highly recommend this app to anyone, who‚Äôs willing to learn."
2019,Absolutely brilliant. Expands your brain power while teaching you new topics. Very entertaining and I can‚Äôt stop playing and learning. There are also so many practice problems to take you to mastery of the topic. My two favorite courses so far were the Ace the AMC and math competition fundamentals because they really taught me to think critically.
2019,"Well made, I can see the great minds behind each lesson, still with few glitches though!"
2019,What could be better than getting smarter every day with this app?
2019,"Great source of fun, interesting knowledge."
2019,"The app is extremely polished and works like a charm, no Bugs or glitches to speak of, and the content itself is great. I love having interesting problems with well done and helpful explanations delivered to my phone daily at all times. Even without the paid subscription I highly recommend to everyone I know that likes puzzles and learning."
2019,"... But it seems very well designed and I'm learning.  This is only day one of use though, I'll update this review after using it awhile."
2019,Really great app
2019,I‚Äôm so terrible with logic and this app has helped me be more aware of solutions to problems.
2019,A great app to learn about the world around you and many other things.
2019,The app is great and it offers as good of an experience as the site. Totally worth paying for the full content.
2019,This app is both super aesthetically and functionally pleasing and incredibly fun. I'm an engineer and like to stay fresh on a few skills that are a bit outside of my everyday use in my current job. This really hits the core of a concept and allows you to feel accomplished by actually learning and passing quizzes
2019,This app is by far the greatest app for educational purposes.
2019,I do think the subscription is rather costly.
2019,Better than Khan Academy
2019,By far the best app I‚Äôve taken the time to download. I‚Äôve never left a review but I love what this app is doing. It‚Äôs like duolingo for math and science. Very good pacing and you can tell the creators actually care about what they are making.
2019,The app teaches in a very fun and entertaining way.

2019,It really helps me with my critical thinking.
2019,Fun & very difficult and explanation helps your understanding.
2019,"Nothing I could say could add. It‚Äôs already been said by countless reviews, people from my life, folks on YouTube and forums, professionals. I can‚Äôt wait for the new courses to arrive!"
2019,"Looks and feels nice, and the content is broken down well for beginners to understand."
2019,"Check it out for yourself.

My meager words will not do it justice."
2019,"Between the simple design and high quality content, there is much to gain from the application. I was satisfied the moment I dipped my first toe in the water, and now I'm a subscriber. I have no regrets and recommend Brilliant to anyone seeking a challenge or a chance to learn something new.
Thank you, and keep doing what you're doing!"
2019,Puzzles that are simply stated with interesting solutions.
2019,"I‚Äôm a broke 14 year old who can‚Äôt afford premium, but this app has helped me develop my brain farther than my school ever has and ever will. I owe it the entirety of my IQ."
2019,Works just as well as the site.
2019,Terrific! Nothing compares to brilliant!
2019,"This app is so fun, and I am learning so much, so fast!"
2019,I like this app but it is a little weird at how it is set up Just like all the bets apps are I do redeemed it but make sure you like it be for speeding money
2019,Thanks for this app. I‚Äôm just discovering it‚Äôs fascinating way of learning. I‚Äôm using it to learn a few new ideas.

2019,It‚Äôs nice. Some of the explanations could link to remedial courses.. but overall it‚Äôs clean and very instructional.
2019,"I‚Äôm a few days in but this app has been very enjoyable! The daily quizzes provide new lessons and information in a fun and easy to understand way. The explanations are to the point. The user interaction is excellent and detailed. 

I would very much recommend this app for anyone wanting to learn a little bit more about the world around them and who want to exercise their brain more! And the daily quizzes are great for on the go learners!"
2019,I like it! Learning in my free time!
2019,"This company is both the hero we need and the hero we deserve, five seconds on this app and you‚Äôll be able to taste a brighter future."

2019,Love it and recommend it
2019,"It just a verry well put together system and with all you can do even without the subscription, all you can learn in just a couple minutes a day, that makes this a top notch appüëç"
2019,Hard to understand but I like it.
2019,I wish I could save or bookmark the section on iOS for later review as I can from their website.
2019,Really enjoying it.
2019,Great app for brain exercise using fragmented time
2019,Fun way to exercise your üß†
2019,Great app challenging!
2019,"This app helped me realize my passion for math and science. Its tactile learning approach versus force feeding theory to its users is the perfect approach to promote practice, trial, and error. Highly recommended."
2019,The most brilliant app literally I have ever seen. Thanks a lot.
2019,"It takes approximately the amount of time one might spend on a short Facebook clip to go through an exercise. The topics may span but a mile wide and an inch deep, but it is a great introduction to topics you may not have otherwise encountered."
2019,Stuff like this is the future of education. Very intuitive way to learn and improve your knowledge. Highly recommend.
2019,"I love brilliant, it is the #1 educational app for advanced subjects that I know of. It‚Äôs just awesome"

2020,Cool
2020,Breaks down complex content well.
2020,coolest app to train your brain... Thanks to the creators
2020,If I weren‚Äôt unemployed I would definitely buy the full version I love practicing it keeps me sharp
2020,"The app aids in helping the user think beyond the box and explore solutions creatively. Beyond assisting learners to getting the answers right, the app encourages students to arrive at the correct conclusions, and to understand why."
2020,It‚Äôs really good it has good information
2020,Best APP ever. All levels.
2020,"Fantastic Idea, Incredible Design and Fabulous execution!"
2020,A wonderful trail and guide and coach and tutor for the curious to learn and perhaps grow in understanding.
2020,The daily challenges were fun
2020,Great game. The end
2020,Whenever Is have a few free minutes I can put my brain to work with Brilliant.
2020,"The creators have put lot of thoughts in creating these courses. Really enjoyable way of learning, sharpening your math and analytical skills"
2020,"This program has a great way of showing algebraic (and others) identities visually where before in school I was asked to memorize them. Very cool. Definitely gets my puzzle brain working on math, which is the way math is supposed to be."
2020,"I love this program so much. I, personally, am enjoying exploring new material and new ways of looking at old material; I have begun ‚Äúprescribing‚Äù the app to some of my students who are weak critical thinkers and are more ‚Äúalgorithm-centered‚Äù in their approach to mathematics."
2020,I have indeed enjoyed learning with Brilliant!
2020,My 13 yr old daughter loves this app!
2020,Nuff said
2020,Just using the free version but have still enjoyed the courses that they offer and the quizzes have been informative. Maybe in the future I will pull the trigger on the $150 subscription but right now the free courses are just fine.
2020,Great app
2020,"It‚Äôs honestly really hard to get credible information these days, and even good teachers. Brilliant does a really good job explaining and teaching in their courses, and the technology they use is really up to date, like the displays of how electricity flows. Although I might be a little dumb for the information in this app, I still enjoy it every time I use it, and it is irreplaceable."
2020,Amazing app for beginners and experts. I use it to warmup on out-of-practice topics and to learn new technologies.
2020,we all spend way too much nonproductive time on our phones. brilliant has helped me turn down time into another way to exercise my brain and keep up to date with skills i already have. it‚Äôs also given me an amazing new way to learn the basics of things that are new to me!
2020,Great stuff
2020,Mentally stimulating and in a format that's highly entertaining. They hit the mark with this one
2020,Just great
2020,Can‚Äôt get enough.
2020,I‚Äôve tried a lot of the brain game apps and this one is by far the best. Great design and execution. Highly recommend.
2020,"I learned more in the first three months of using this app than I did in four years at university. The Brilliant method of learning is a true breakthrough in education, and it appears that they are just getting started."
2020,"black lives matter, justice for Breonna Taylor ‚úäüèΩ"
2020,"I am fascinated! New to this app, and so far it‚Äôs great!!! Thank you. You‚Äôve helping me to get back on exercising my mind on math. Long time wanted to do so, but lack of encouragement.  Grateful to have it."
2020,Amazing app!  Highly recommend for people who love learning and puzzle solving.
2020,I love this app I can learn quickly and anywhere anytime.
2020,Loving this website.  Such great presentation and development of ideas
2020,"Really enjoying it, amazing content in digestible and understandable parts. Definitely not for the professional trying to grow an employable skillset, but for me as a software engineer who wants to brush up on high school math and science, it‚Äôs absolutely brilliant, pun intended."
2020,Very fun
2020,I‚Äôm prepping for case interviews and really enjoy the clean format and tutorials!
2020,I learned a lot
2020,I enjoy it. The explanations is easy to understand. The problem solving is fun.
2020,Brilliant is awesome for educational performance as it has a billion courses and 60 for free
2020,Really good app and the free version is extremely educational
2020,My kids are required to ‚Äúplay‚Äù on this app at least an hour per day to supplement public school. I also love using it every morning. They teach the most interesting subjects in easy to understand ways.
2020,Keeps me up late!
2020,Just SOLID. Teaches the concepts very gracefully and atomically.
2020,"I‚Äôve only been using Brilliant a week, but it‚Äôs so much more interesting and engaging and fun than similar learning apps.  The experience is like a combination of doing mini- courses with puzzle and game apps.  I *never* learned math this way‚Äîit would have changed the whole experience for me!  (I‚Äôm almost sixty years old and doing this mostly for fun, though I‚Äôm hoping it might help me with some novice level coding I‚Äôm also learning.) The interface is also very attractive and clean.  

My only suggestion: offer two levels of explanation.  There were a few questions where the explanation was so brief, it was kind of puzzle itself.  I understand you want to keep things brief‚Äîthat‚Äôs good.  That‚Äôs why I suggest two levels of explanation: first button says ‚ÄúShow explanation.‚Äù But then another button appears at the bottom that says, maybe, ‚Äú Need more detailed explanation?‚Äù for us beginners.  But this is a minor critique.  I‚Äôm really enjoying it.  Highly recommend!"
2020,It a great app to keep your brain up and fresh. Makes your brain calculate.
2020,I really enjoy the way Brilliant takes all the steps and programs to show different aprrroaches to unapproachable problems.
2020,Nice web site and have enjoyed the complimentary access; still thinking about the nearly $150 annual subscription price.
2020,Great game!!
2020,Best self learning platform I‚Äôve used to date üëç
2020,This APP is amazingggggg I‚Äôm learning sooo much . this help me be smarter and to accomplish my dream of being a mathematical scientist
2020,This is my first review ever! I had to share my opinion because this is absolutely the BEST app I have ever used. Beautiful and simple layout. Easy to use. I never pay for app subscriptions but I‚Äôm making an exception for this one. Thank you!
2020,Great exercises and explanations!
2020,I love it so far. Teaches you the basics with visuals in addition to procedures.
2020,I never review apps but I‚Äôve been looking for a good brain training app for ages and this one is perfect I love it so much
2020,I love this simple design of the app and the easy accessible courses. Plus it‚Äôs free.
2020,Great
2020,Fell much smarter
2020,Great app to learn science!!!
2020,Really helps me stay informed in all areas I‚Äôm interested in.
2020,Perfect for helping me brush up on my math skills and understand things in a new way.
2020,Pretty good for students
2020,The title describes it
2020,"I decided to conquer my fears of inadequacy and stay open to this app, and even in one week I can see how it‚Äôs paying off.  About six months ago, I tried it but was quickly intimidated and even uninstalled the app. This time, however, I‚Äôm staying open and not judging myself when I get incorrect answers. (Although once I did judged the app developers for an ‚Äúincorrect‚Äù answer of mine, but while writing a feedback to them for why their answer and explanation to their answer were incorrect, I realized why their answer was right and what I had missed in my own deductive training to have tracked the incorrect conclusion. LOL.)  I do get a nice little dopamine hit though when I see that ‚ÄúCorrect!‚Äù after hitting ‚Äúsubmit.‚Äù 

The program presents in a way that is really encouraging to just get in there and work my mind in new ways. I noticed I feel better and more organized in my thinking when I start my day with about 20+ minutes of these kinds of brain exercises in the morning. So I have my coffee and breakfast while working through some problems in a relaxed way. 

I‚Äôm looking forward to trying other courses/programs after I finish the Logic one."
2020,"I‚Äôm going to college and taking academic courses for the first time in several years. I failed the first day assessment for Elementary Statistics, so I dropped it. Since then, I‚Äôve been trying to brush up on my math in various ways. However, most of the ‚Äútraditional‚Äù ways have either not worked, brought up negative associations for me, or both. This app TEACHES math from the ground up, along with many neat tips and tricks, in a way that‚Äôs novel and fun for me, but not insulting to my intelligence or dignity. Plus, this app‚Äôs approach to teaching math visually and conceptually is getting through to me in ways that several math teachers have failed to do. I only have the FREE version, too! Don‚Äôt let the subscription cost scare you! You CAN download, use, and benefit from Brilliant without paying a dime!"
2020,I am always looking for different ways to keep my mind sharp and Brilliant is an excellent way to keep my mind sharp and learn something new or learn something old in a new way.
2020,"A wonderful brainy app, really fun way to learn about challenging subjects in bite-sized increments using delightful graphics.  Love it!"
2020,Good for the mind
2020,"Amazing app, definitely helps in your logic in Mathematics and Physics, probably other subjects too, I just have not tried compsci yet"
2020,"I am a 7th grade student, before I used to get into a lot of trouble at school (I never did my homework, hated my teachers). All around just did not like it. Then I started using brilliant and it was probably the best thing that has ever happened to me my grades shot up. I had all As and Bs but my computer science was definitely the best I had a 140% in the class that is unbelievable thinking that before that was one of my least favorite classes I was shocked there are so many things to learn on the app."
2020,Best game I‚Äôve ever experienced
2020,This app teaches its users through fun challenges.
2020,Jjdjdjddj
2020,"I wish I had this resource when I was young! I went to engineering school in the early 1970s, and my understanding of the math concepts would have been a lot better. Brilliant is a great site and I enjoy working on the problems. 

Note: I saw earlier that you were working on an automotive engineering course. It was taken down before it was finished. Will it be re-posted at some time? As someone who has built and drives a dirt track race car I would love to go through it"
2020,Easy way to sharpen your skills
2020,"I used this app to get back into science and math before going back to school and I found it really helpful!! There are quite a few courses I‚Äôve taken and I love all the material, it‚Äôs very engaging and well developed. Also it‚Äôs pretty :) And I like the daily puzzles"
2020,Not a bot
2020,Great for mental breaks
2020,Cool
2020,Motivates the brain !!!
2020,"Love the content, pointers, tips, and techniques. Basic fundamentals to complex arithmetic questions. Good for students or anyone who wants to have a sharp ‚ÄúBrilliant‚Äù mind."
2020,Gets you thinking with parts of your brain you did no know you had
2020,I was wondering why isn't there more scientific courses like biology or physics and more CS courses?
2020,Haven‚Äôt bought a subscription yet but for 150 USD for an entire year of a vast array of easy to understand knowledge is definitely worth every last penny.
2020,"I am a new user and just enjoy the puzzles. Looking forward to refreshing a lot of math, science and computer science concepts during this lockdown."
2020,It‚Äôs a good app for beginners
2020,"This is a great app and the structure of the questions is well written throughout the courses I‚Äôve completed so far. 

However, It‚Äôs a bit pricey though. 
$24.99 monthly and yearly is $149.99.

Maybe offer student pricing? 
Or maybe a points system; where when you use the app so many times or get so many correct answers, it can earn you a free month or something. 
That could be an incentive to keep people coming back to the app as well as rewarding them for their consistency. 
Which would also allow more people to benefit from the app even if they have financial struggles.

Let‚Äôs make education more accessible for everyone."
2020,I like this a lot
2020,"I recently had to step down from my surgical practice after my ninth major spinal operation. Although that kind of sucked, a good consolation prize has been that I get to study, read, and learn whatever I want to. I‚Äôve become very interested in quantum mechanics and astrophysics, but have realized that I simply did not have enough mathematical knowledge to learn what I wanted to. I needed multivariable calculus, partial diff equations, and linear algebra to properly learn what I want to. Brilliant.org has been excellent to achieve those goals. Furthermore, just looking through the various courses available have gotten me excited to learn about machine learning, neural networks, computational biology, quantum computing....the list goes on and on.  I highly recommend this app to anyone who wants to learn or review a multitude of math, science, and computer science topics."
2020,Absolutely brilliant.
2020,"I‚Äôm always skeptical of brain exercising type apps finding them mostly laughable at best but Brilliant has proven to put my reservations to rest. It‚Äôs been enjoyable along with educational, and the clarity of its instruction/directions to follow for each problem to solve is seamless within the experience."
2020,Not much else to say really
2020,Great app!
2020,"I have subscribed to Brilliant almost a week ago (Dec. 16, 2020). I had a technical issue with the payment which resulted in me being double charged for the subscription. I wrote to the technical support more than once and finally the issue was resolved promptly and professionally (perhaps they were busy with the holidays and end of year activities). As for the App itself, it is excellent (as anyone can tell from the limited free access features) and I look forward to them adding more fundamental science and engineering topics, complementing them with effective assessment techniques to affirm the learning."
2020,üëçüí´
2020,I love how this app shows different perspectives when teaching a concept.
2020,"Course material should be displayed in fullscreen, not an ephemeral pop-up style view."
2020,"This app is great for mental exercise and learning. It takes intimidating and complex topics and breaks them down simply and intuitively.

 I never felt confident in math and after months of casually using this, I can feel the connections being made from the lessons to problems outside of it! Worth the subscription if you want to keep a sharp mind."
2020,"The nueral network course is incredibly insightful and digestible, this really shored up my contextual understanding before getting into implementation"
2020,Really interactive learning.
2020,"Very good tutorials, very well thought to explain some fishy concepts in math."
2020,"Great format, interesting exercises. Good explanations."
2020,"A great app, super fun logic puzzles"
2020,Wish it was a little more affordable during the pandemic. But very good from the free days I‚Äôve tried it out.
2020,I love the explanation feature
2020,Easy to understand
2020,It‚Äôs fun and worthwhile
2020,Can‚Äôt get enough of brilliant....a former Quantum Physics instructor.
2020,Must have study/work aid
2020,"I‚Äôm pretty new to this app, but it really helped me grow my brain. That doesn‚Äôt mean that I learned a bunch, I mean I did but that‚Äôs not the point. The real think it helped me grow is how I think, and how good I am at it"
2020,I have really enjoyed learning for about computer Science with this app and website!!
2020,Challenging and fun
2020,Why can‚Äôt coursera or udemy figure this out?
2020,This is truly an amazing app for math and sciences geeks like me.
2020,Very crazy how easy and fun it is to learn and retain information. This is how most teachers curriculum should be.
2020,Love it
2020,"Best app I have used. Gives mental test and challenges in every subject. It also offers all subjects. I feel like I have learned something new each time. This is very helpful for my 51 year old mind. It keeps me sharp and my skills sharp. Cause if you do not use it, you lose it."
2020,Great app to learn many things
2020,Provides useful skill sets for stats and probability functions
2020,I have been using Brilliant for about a month and have enjoyed it thoroughly. The learning is very engaging and well thought out.  I am very impressed.
2020,Great app to understand/refresh Math/science topics.
2020,"Real interactive problem solving that teaches you, not just a passive audio spiel you forget."
2020,"This is an awesome app and is definitely an investment for someone who identifies with being a life long learner. If you‚Äôre interested in learning a subject from a different, more approachable, perspective, then this is the app for you!  

I was hesitant at first but glad I got this because it helped me a lot with physics and computer science. It takes time to really lay out the ground work without skipping out the more advance stuff either. Would love to see more advance math, physics, and programming courses."
2020,Interesting and engaging topics presented in a fun way. Do I need to say more? This is so much better and interesting entertainment than a time waster app...
2020,"I have never been a math or logic person, so the problems in this app were more challenging to me than they were for most. I wish something like this, with problems and explanations, all for free‚Äîwere accessible when I was younger. I wouldn‚Äôt have known where to start looking! If I started at a young age, my math skills would be better, and I may have actually done math for fun.

This the kind of stuff that they ask on IQ tests, not the silly memory or perceptual reasoning stuff they have on online IQ tests. Perceptual reasoning and working memory do not require preconceived knowledge or study like verbal reasoning does (verbal reasoning includes vocabulary and mathematics). However, all three measures can be improved with practice. You just have to know where to find the challenges."
2020,It helped me understand derivatives and integrals
2020,Worth every penny. Money well spent with a great return on every penny.
2020,"Exhilarating and !!!ü•∞Entertainingü•∞!!! way to master complex STEM concepts.  Challenging puzzles with incisive clear illustrated explanations.  As a retired academic researcher and classroom teacher, I do SO Wish that the GENIUS Brilliant program had been available to teachers serving poor inner-city students and their families - WHAT a breathtakingly positive effect it could have had on the STEM academic achievement of my precious ‚Äúchickadees.‚Äù."
2020,"This platform is highly intuitive, and covers so many relevant topics. I especially appreciate the visual methods used to simply explain complex concepts."
2020,A great way to build some different thinking and processing into my day.  I love the daily challenges- they are core to my morning routine now.  The longer-form programs are really well thought-out and I both learn and stay sharp.  Highly recommended.
2020,And it‚Äôs a good app so I‚Äôll leave it a good review.
2020,"I got this app because I‚Äôm mathematically challenged. As an adult that struggles with math I have to say I love the way this app provides instruction. Each set of quizzes starts with an explanation of the material and even if you answer incorrectly there are detailed explanations of how you can figure out the correct answer. I‚Äôve had to be patient with myself but I‚Äôm making progress. My favorite class so far has been the one on logic puzzles, something I have struggled with in the past and Brilliant provides such excellent instruction that sometimes I‚Äôm very surprised at how well I‚Äôm doing answering the questions. It‚Äôs by no means easy but it‚Äôs designed to make it easy to learn. It‚Äôs definitely worth it."
2020,"Best app for learning, honestly!"
2020,This is great. It allows you to see math in a different way. Connects concept in various forms to make the abstract relatable. Very cool.
2020,I use this app to fill the computer science knowledge I don‚Äôt have. It‚Äôs introducing me to ways to tackle different problems.
2020,Lb hi
2020,Love it!!! Found out about it from mark rober!!
2020,Really enjoy using Brilliant with my kids to study computing and mathematics.
2020,You can make your concepts clear. You might know formule but you might not have concepts. If thats the case this is the best app you‚Äôll find in market !
2020,So far I have only done the intro lessons but it is making me highly consider purchasing for the year. It‚Äôs a great app that explains the problems very thoroughly!
2020,"Esta aplicaci√≥n hace que todo la l√≥gica matem√°tica sea divertida.

This App makes that mathematical thinking looks fun."
2020,Yuh
2020,Ok this app stupid because you have to pay 150 dollars a year or month.
2020,"I was recommended this app by YouTuber I watch, Mayuko. The app is honestly phenomenal! Learning seems really easy and fun, I actually enjoyed coming back to it everyday :)"
2020,"I love the animations and simplicity of the app. They do a great job of breaking down complicated topics. Currently, I‚Äôm taking the fundamentals of computer science course and am learning a lot."
2020,"This app is great! The modules are decent lengths so it never seems too overwhelming or long, but contain enough information to really convey the topic well. 

I haven‚Äôt done many modules yet, so I can‚Äôt say too much more other than that, but once I get through them, I‚Äôll post an update."
2020,Title
2020,Very specific and well adjusted but very hardcore.
2020,"I love the work you guys do with my favorite you tubers, you guys rock"
2020,"Brilliant not only has very interesting and challenging courses, they present difficult topics in ways that make them simple to understand.  Fantastic service."

2020,great app
2020,I love learning how to do this all
2020,Does not over complicate the lessons and they are effective.
2020,Really enjoying the challenge. Even the beginner levels are challenging. There‚Äôs enough here to keep you busy for a long time.
2020,Have you been feeling dumb as rocks lately? Use this app.
2020,I love this app
2020,Great
2020,And engineering must have !!!
2020,Challenge questions along the way make for more careful reading and deeper understanding.  The didactics seem well-developed.  Frequent applications promote better understanding.  The way the material is presented is more engaging to me than other platforms that are heavily based on videos.  It allows me to go faster through areas that I already know.
2020,I am loving this app! There are so many real world instances and experiences that these courses apply to! They just happen to be at the right time:) that they are meant to fully graspüêí. Thank you!
2020,Great design and great app!
2020,This is by far the best app I‚Äôve seen. It does a better job at teach concepts in a fun way than all of my college professors did.
2020,Love this app. Makes you think logically and pick out the important stuff in algebra..love it
2020,I love this app. It has everything I want and need to further my knowledge and review what I have forgotten over the years.
2020,"I have been using Elevate for eight years, and Peak for two years. I enjoy challenging my brain and memory in skills that are not frequently tasked by my job.  I began using Brilliant and found that it complemented my brain exercise training perfectly.  It is fun, applicable, and practical.  

As far as the price tag, it might be significant but considering the value of the training I justify my purchase in my particular case."
2020,Good way to work your logic and problem solving.
2020,"This the best app I‚Äôve seen in a long time. I need some better than the same old movies. Such relief 
THANK YOU"
2020,This app helps me to think and talk my time
2020,Its very very good but its expensive
2020,"Great learning opportunity. Helps not memorize information, but really internalize it by solving problems yourself. Recommend spending free time on this app rather than on social media apps that would commonly consume free time between work or during bath room breaks."
2020,Great bite-sized lessons
2020,"Long story short ,as a 20yo studing mathematics ,this app is for people who wanna think more and better ; questions are wonderful and voted up explanations which have given by community members are too , the only sad part is that some quizzes are only for premium members and apparently unavailable for iranian users , but thank you that the whole thing isn‚Äôt :,)
I even set a daily alarm to remind me do my daily brain exercise 
Thank you brilliant community , which you literally are <3"
2020,Marvelous generation building tool.
2020,In depth learning activities really helps me with most of my highschool classes.
2020,"No matter what age you are, if you are passionate about learning, teaching and bringing best out of anybody, this app is a MUST. Thanks Brilliant."
2020,I don‚Äôt usually write app reviews but this one is an anomaly. It‚Äôs honestly splendid and I can‚Äôt think of a single flaw to point out. Job well done!
2020,I love using brilliant. It makes me... well... Brilliant! Highly recommend this app.
2020,Both addictive and worthwhile feeling. A good balance of being a game and a challenge worth solving :)
2020,Great learning resource.
2020,"I don‚Äôt like to play games on my phone. I find the games annoying and incredibly unproductive, but this app is great. If I‚Äôm bored, I can take a course and learn something so I‚Äôm always productive."
2020,Yes
2020,"As an intelligent guy, I constantly get bored. This app is great in that it, challenges my mind to solve new and unfamiliar complex problems. There's so many catergories of problems to chose from! I highly recommend!"
2020,Loved taking the Logic course. This app is genius and so fun. Worth every penny. I wish I could afford it.
2020,Love this app and their everyday challenges... they make it so fun!
2020,Very explanatory and clear
2020,"Signed up for premium and downloaded a few courses to go thru in offline mode for my upcoming flight. When I boarded the plane and turned on airplane mode (full offline, no wifi) I was able to access the courses with no issues. The bug I think your dev team way want to look into is when the wifi is still enabled (southwest airlines free wifi for free messaging apps but no internet browsing or similar). The downloaded courses should have still worked but were not accessible. Really loving the app so far otherwise!"
2020,Keeping me sharp during this pandemic
2020,"About to finish my first course, Computer Science Fundamentals!"
2020,Good app
2020,"It‚Äôs a interesting set of puzzles that just give you a good workout, I have been searching for something similar for a while and am happy I found it."
2020,What‚Äôs next
2020,Love the challenge.
2020,I love solitaire games but was getting bored with card and word games. I tried Brilliant to fill my need for solitaire games and to re-learn some science and math skills I have long forgotten. This app did not disappoint. Not only am I relearning I am learning new things and in new ways!
2020,"I‚Äôm reading up on Lambda Calculus now‚Äîpretty nice wiki!

I wish there were a way to give feedback. On some of the logic items, there is some squishiness in the language."
2020,"I enjoy the questions, & the explanations when I miss one! Good for my brain when I want to get away from my other activities."
2020,"I love this app as it has real problems to solve using logic or math or other mental skills. I love that it also offers an explanation and actually teaches how to get the correct answers. Other brain teaser apps that I‚Äôve tried have answers that are loosely tied to the problem and either have multiple correct answers or leave you guessing for the right solution- this app leads you to one possible solution given the data provided in the problem. So you either get it right by understanding how to solve it, or you get it wrong and can try again or seek out the explanation. I am only on the free trial right now. I just wish it wasn‚Äôt so expensive."
2020,Overall positive experience so far.
2020,Great topics presented in an interesting and intriguing way. I‚Äôm enjoying this app!
2020,I love this app!
2020,Good for practice!
2020,Great app

It gives lessons on a great platform with great support and I would recommend it to anyone who would listen!"
2020,I absolutely love this
2020,It‚Äôs great so far. Plain and simple. You want to learn? You need an explanation? It‚Äôs there to re-read. Take a quiz. So far so good for me. Thumbs up!
2020,"Lots of good content, at multiple levels of difficulty, don‚Äôt need school with an app like this ü§òüèº"
2020,This helped me with struggles in different courses
2020,This app has minimal ads and does a great explanation for each question.
2020,I love it it has helped me reach a faster thinking rate and get better I. Class and impress my parents üôÇ
2020,"Thank you, Brilliant!"
2020,Beautiful
2020,This is a much better way than social media to fill the time in a queue. I felt some of my brain cells snapping to attention as I used some algebra. Look forward to learning more.
2020,"Really enjoy this app and service- it is a great way to take a break and apply your brain in solving problems - to the point of applying knowledge you acquired all through your life, since school sometimes. 
Love it. And if you are into puzzles you would love this too."
2020,Love the quiz based approach
2020,It‚Äôs a fun thing to do when your bored
2020,Great learning tool.

2020,"I love this! The quizzes and activities are very well done. I love this and they give explanations on every problem. This will give you more in depth examples. I learn a lot, I use it as my math tutor."
2020,"Absolutely Amazing! I love this app until this point every time I looked at math it stressed me out and I avoided it as much as possible this app makes it easy to learn and teaches me my mistakes, I‚Äôm so happy that math doesn‚Äôt scare me away anymore, I‚Äôm excited to learn. I failed all my high school math classes and this app has taken more time to teach me than my teachers in school! Thank you so much! I would love to get something similar for English as it is my favorite subject!"
2020,Probably the only Apple subscription I don't regret
2020,"Great app. Clear, responsive, and filled with useful questions that can truly enhance your abilities. If you‚Äôre a student and want some personal development during your free time, this app is for you."

2020,"As someone who is looking to further their education, l am greatly impressed by this app and the depths of which it explores the fields of science and mathematics."
2020,"I believe info/knowledge should be free to all of humanity but due to the past conflicts/misconceptions humanity is divided more than ever even though the whole planet is quarantined as a whole universally to hamper ‚Äúour‚Äù progress to expand to the stars to obtain unlimited resources. Yet the global Cabal Elite prevent most prosperity. 
This is what things should be. Unite and share knowledge (divided we fall)."
2020,"I don‚Äôt like playing games on my devices. But I really enjoy this app.  It has logical, understandable progressions through physics, algebra, math.  It stimulates me.  I am 69-years old, and I feel like this keeps me sharp."

2020,We tend to forget how little we really know until it‚Äôs too late. Stay young! Stay brilliant!
2020,easy to use. help keep your brain active
2020,"This has been so refreshing! I‚Äôm all about puzzles; they come naturally to me, so this is perfect!! ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
2020,Helped me a lot with my interview
2020,"If you are looking for any educational courses, this is it."
2020,Great
2020,This is much better than playing a mindless game on my phone. Love it.
2020,"This app is amazing. I downloaded it originally when I was looking for resources to brush up on physics. Since then, I decided to enroll in a math class at my local community college‚ÄîBrilliant made learning so easy that my confidence has skyrocketed and I started daydreaming about earning a STEM degree.

Of course, I used Brilliant to study for my math placement test, and after only working through half of the algebra and trig courses I tested in to Pre-Calc! I haven‚Äôt taken a math class since high school, ten years ago! I‚Äôm still using Brilliant on the topics I find difficult, the easy step by step process is so good at breaking down complex problems and helping you understand.

It‚Äôs well explained and done with love. I bought the annual subscription and don‚Äôt regret it"
2020,Excellent
2020,Great app to learn the foundamentals
2020,I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm wasting time on my phone anymore!
2020,I like it
2020,Brilliant is very brilliant. They have logic problems and they are super hard but not the kind of hard you are thinking of it is a fun kind of hard.
2020,This app is truly amazing at engaging your brain and making you think!
2020,"Don‚Äôt hesitate to get the app or just go to their website, wether you want to learn new concepts, hone your skills or just find an engaging pass time, brilliant has something for everyone!"
2020,"Great way to keep sharp, courses are engaging with interactive quizzes. Would recommend to anyone including the average hobbyist looking to learn more."
2020,is baller. :-)
2020,So engaging and informative. I really enjoy using this app to learn.

2020,:)
2020,"I have never written a review for any app, but Brilliant warrants a genuine review. This product includes a perfect mix of material and concepts are explained in a way to keep your interest sustained."
2020,yeah
2020,Only issue so far is being interrupted to write this review. I guess I‚Äôm doing it because I want to. Now let me learn!!!
2020,I‚Äôm currently using this service to learn multivariable calculus and I‚Äôm loving it!
2020,A great app. I‚Äôve ran through the logic and math sections and have enjoyed them very much. Can‚Äôt wait to explore more.
2020,"I got it to study Python and Calculus. I wouldn‚Äôt say its as mind blowing as the advertising, but then......it kinda is. Its easy and I interact well, curious to see how it goes over a whole course"
2020,Great way to learn things which felt almost impossible to grasp.
2020,Better than spending lost time on social media platforms.
2020,Top level brain workout
2020,This is a great way for me to make sure that I‚Äôm staying sharp over the summer and I love the laid-back feeling in all the activities.
2020,Cool it‚Äôs fun
2020,Dis good
2020,I love the idea of this app and I am totally addicted now. This app has made learning so much fun. I wish there was option to download more than 6 courses at a time but it‚Äôs not a deal breaker. This app still deserves a 5 star review.
2020,My seven-year-old has been eating it up!!! On his own for the most part! We love this!!
2020,Just what I was looking for to stimulate the cobwebs of my mind!
2020,Very interesting & trying!!
2020,"I really like all of the courses Brilliant is able to offer, and do hope more come out in the nearby future."
2020,"This is the best ‚Äúbrain training‚Äù site I have used.  The others make you feel good by charting your ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù while you optimize mnemonics and procedures to become more efficient with some game. That isn‚Äôt really growth; you aren‚Äôt learning.

This is different. Brilliant asks great questions that require productive struggle, the true hallmark of brain growth.  The structure of the questions leads you to deepen your understanding of math and science intuitively, while still being grounded in rigorous logic.

I teach advanced math, and this my #1 choice when students or parents ask for enrichment resources.  I use it for personal growth; it‚Äôs wonderful."
2020,This app has given me a broad approach to the basic principles of subjects most popular in the world. Such as math and computer science. This app shows me a different way I could think about problems and it encourage you to keep a open mind on the problems you are about to solve. This app is great for daily exercises that enforces problem solving skills.
2020,This is the best educational tool I came across! Really well done! The speed at which you learn is fantastic. I wish for more and more courses.
2020,I wanted a learning game that would be interesting (make it fun to learn) so I could still be learning in the summer. This is perfect!!!  Í®Ñ‚ô•Ô∏éÍ®Ñ
2020,"Best app for learning at your own pace. Very interesting topics. Greatly enjoyed Calculus, Computer Science, and probability. Highly advise anyone to try the premium version."
2020,Haven‚Äôt used this app for a while but the logic course I‚Äôve taken during the free trial alone has opened my eyes to some really cool logic concepts. It‚Äôs looking to be a really helpful way to understand these otherwise mythical and complex concepts that would be invisible ideas to the average joe.
2020,It a good way to learn math üìùüßÆand science üß™
2020,"This app is so cool! I‚Äôve learned so much and I live the free daily challenge.  But the full version dosent give you THAT much, and 200$ is a lot of money.  So I recommend downloading this app for a daily challenge and a nice learning experience experience but the pro version is a bit too overpriced."
2020,"I been always wanted something to make me learn just have fun learning and discovering the best app ever out there and the smartest developers that made this beautiful app .
Is worth of the money even if they asked more I would pay .
This is Genius beautiful and I recommend this to whom want to learn from scratch and for the professionals too .
Love you guys keep it up don‚Äôt let me down I‚Äôm doing it ."
2020,A great way to learn new things that I didn‚Äôt know before!
2020,"Just using the free trial at this point and I‚Äôm totally enjoying it. I haven‚Äôt gotten into the courses as of yet because the daily challenges have been keeping me busy and are fun. 
The yearly price tag is a hard pill to swallow but I‚Äôm 51% sure I‚Äôll pay it."
2020,"Horrifically expensive, but indispensable. I use it constantly and it‚Äôs really helped deepen my understanding."
2020,I appreciate it forcing me to really focus at a higher intensity than the usual level of focus which i feel is under constant assault by media
2020,I love the app!
2020,Amazing go get it
2020,"The illustrations and explanations make it interesting to read. Asking you if you know what they‚Äôre going to say next based on the information given you make it interactive, and the overall layout is immaculate."
2020,Just brilliant!
2020,This is a great way to pass the time while keeping your mind active
2020,"it‚Äôs pretty challenging, for someone who hasn‚Äôt been in a math class in over a year"
2020,"Great to get my mind working again, and love re-learning concepts in new ways. The visual learning tools in this app are next level."
2020,"Fun, easy get it!"
2020,I‚Äôve been teaching myself Computer Science and honestly this app has helped me learn the basic understandings of what it actually is to be a Computer Scientist Engineer.
2020,Lots of fun to play and challenge yourself!!
2020,I like the problems with clear explanations. Efficient and high yield presentations.

2020,This is the only app I continuously use even though I get all the tests wrong! Lol. It‚Äôs a great learning experience.
2020,Absolutely love it!
2020,"Brilliant helps you not just learn a subject. School does that. It helps you understand it. Taking an active role in learning and understanding is vital for the future of invention and creativity, and brilliant is taking the steps necessary to help facilitate growth."
2020,This app has helped me learn the basics of python along with various other math subject and continues to keep me interested! Also looking forward to all the subjects that will be added in the future!
2020,"This app is fun and helps keep brain sharp, refreshed and stimulated. Thx Brilliant üôÇ!"
2020,"I‚Äôm an educated guy, master‚Äôs degree and own several businesses but I always found myself playing stupid phone games in my down time, wasting so much time.  With Brilliant, I‚Äôm still enjoying the down time but instead of being mindless I‚Äôm furthering my education in things that really interest me that I‚Äôve known a little about, but it gives the whole picture and really lets you understand things in a larger scope.  I paid for the year and do not regret it in the slightest. If I could give this 10 stars I would."
2020,"Finance, need a boost.!?"
2020,"As someone who was afraid of math in school, this app has been a game changer. I now have a newfound appreciation for quant problems and have improved my skills!"
2020,Hoi
2020,This app is for students and people who are interested in a STEM career but I wish it was free for more in-depth üò¢ besides from that everything is amazing!
2020,I am a nascent researcher and this app is the perfect resource to enable my future efforts!
2020,This is a great way to stay sharp as you get older.
2020,"Really gets you thinking and I play in the morning to challenge my half asleep brain, it‚Äôs just a good workout."
2020,Brilliant is amazing
2020,It‚Äôs so true that practicing problems is better than watching/listening to lectures. Most people learn fatter and better by doing things and practicing them anyways. This is actually (No Pun Intended) BRILLIANT!
2020,Great
2020,"Brilliant is a terrific way to learn computer science fundamentals - especially if you don‚Äôt have big blocks of time. I use Brilliant when I‚Äôm waiting on the doctor/dentist/water to boil, at bedtime, anytime I‚Äôve got 10-20 minutes. The short lessons are interesting and fun."
2020,Good game
2020,I found this app really helpful. It has stimulating and challenging material.
2020,"For less than a Netflix subscription, you get a huge library of amazing interactive courses. This is not memorization, but real understanding. Absolutely priceless."
2020,Solid brain training exercises
2020,Two thumbs up
2020,So this app is amazing and it teaches me a lot of stuff
2020,Very muy bueno
2020,"It sounds drastic, but in a way, elementary education did let me (and many generations) down. It still does. The world of #STEM can be wonderful and interesting, but for the most of my elementary and high school, math was just learning the formulas by heart instead of actually understanding the magic behind. So I was afraid or bored or hated it for the most part... Thanks to Brilliant.org, I'm rediscovering the magic üôÇ"
2020,"They ask for a review early on, but I can say that so far I have found the experience breakthrough stuff. I mean, the method is entertaining and engaging in a new way. I am actually excited about progressing and what I can learn here."
2020,Helps my brain
2020,Love this app
2020,"This is great for daily practice and I highly recommend for anyone who feels they just aren‚Äôt learning to their full capability at school or at home school. It‚Äôs kinda addicting to be honest, I was hesitant about it at first, but now, I use it almost every day!"
2020,Great brain teasers!
2020,Great app
2020,"This app is everything I‚Äôve wanted in a ‚Äúbrain exercise‚Äù app. The puzzles are well scaffolded and the explanations are clear and sometimes revelatory. 

 I‚Äôm learning new things, practicing concepts in ways I‚Äôd never have the opportunity to otherwise, and find this a guilt free way to play with puzzles and ideas because I truly feel I‚Äôm strengthening thinking skills in ways that will pay dividends across my life. 

Very pleased and impressed. Thank you for creating this."
2020,I have been having are you out of fun learning everything I thought I never could learn. I feel like a glossary or highlight definition might make key vocabulary clearer.  I hope you keep you keep adding and adding to it.
2020,"I‚Äôve already noticed improvement in my ability to solve problems, and Brilliant is showing me techniques like elimination grids to map out and solve complex puzzles that apply easily to real life situations. I don‚Äôt feel bad when I get things wrong. Brilliant reminds me that it‚Äôs the best way to learn... from mistakes!"
2020,Love the app
2020,So happy this exists
2020,I use this app whenever I need to prepare for data science interviews. It‚Äôs a great app!
2020,I bought the annual subscription . It has been one of the best investments not only for me but also for my family . We have been practicing most of the topics related to Math and AI/ML. I would highly recommend this. It does a great job of explaining key concepts with great examples. It also simplifies the complex concepts with simple examples and explains the intuition behind these concepts
2020,I have been using it for about a year now and their premium service is fantastic! You learn with challenging but exciting problems that make you think in new ways! Its great and definitely worth it if you want to learn!
2020,Fun math problems to improve your skills
2020,"I‚Äôve only taken one course so far, but the lessons and interactivity is great!"
2020,Brilliant is brilliant! It teaches you everything.
2020,"There are so many fun STEM things to learn about. I like how so many of the lessons are interactive(in one, you use a search engine to figure out how they work). This is a great app for people trying to successfully learn math. I don‚Äôt know why the ratings are so low."
2020,This app makes learning feel like a video game.
2021,Brilliant has allowed me to study and get better at math. It explains everything and gives you important tips to remember when solving questions!!!
2021,"Very attentive when I had a issue with my subscription, highly recommend the company!"
2021,"As an engineer, I find it very refreshing to use the brilliant app to keep my interdisciplinary knowledge up to date! It‚Äôs important to me to understand how principles from other disciplines can affect my designs and also my life overall!"
2021,A great way to put my mind to a test and helps we understand things way better than I do in school. It‚Äôs amazing and I‚Äôve been doing better with the help

2021,Very good mental exercise
2021,I really wish they had this when I was in school. I might have even enjoyed math instead of getting anxiety over it.  The creators did an amazing job. Well done!
2021,I like it bc its fun and learnish and o my golly
2021,"I‚Äôm taking the Fundamentals of Mathematical Reasoning course which trains you to think like a mathematician in a way that feels like a game. Courses uses a slide(s) and question format, showing you problems with animations and stories and then asking you to solve them, with hints available to help you answer yourself. Oftentimes questions on your thinking follow questions about solutions, so you understand other processes you might have not considered. 

Lessons can be fast, ranging from 10-30 minutes, so I can play during lunch breaks or waiting periods. In the later lessons, I notice myself thinking more strategically about the best ways to solve problems and thinking about math in visual representations when possible instead of abstract numbers.

Since my math education was rote, Brilliant is refreshing and fun. Math feels natural, accessible, and engaging to me now, so I find the Premium subscription worth the cost. 

Sometimes the slide graphics display partially or not at all, and Brilliant Support is slow to respond, but this happens rarely and doesn‚Äôt much affect my everyday experience."
2021,"A fun way to learn. Not very technical, you‚Äôre not going to pass a college course with this alone but still engaging and helpful."
2021,"Seriously amazing the only app of its kind to be found on this or any platform. I would go as far as to say that they provided me with a cheap, accessible, and quality education."
2021,"This is a great app to learn about science for all ages. You can learn basic science up to quantum physics. Also, like that it‚Äôs interactive vs just watching a video."
2021,Brilliant is an amazing learning app. They have clear instructions that capture the essence of concepts and use a great mix of lessons/exercises to help reinforce ideas.
2021,"I love the deep learning that this app provides. I find that sometimes, some of the explanations don‚Äôt explain very well, but overall I love it! Super good for those who want to learn for themselves and make sense of math."
2021,Great APP to stimulate your brain!!!
2021,It‚Äôs like a Wikipedia with quizzes. Very great and easy to understand. Highly recommend for anyone and everyone.
2021,"This app is amazing. I'm loving the intro to physics - even though i know the basics, it's introducing topics in a way I've never thought of before. And i never thought I'd be able to understand machine learning, but is presented so well!
This app is absolutely worth the price. I wish i had gotten it years ago."
2021,Made me bust
2021,ÊàëÂæàÂñúÊ¨¢

2021,Want to see more advanced computer course.
2021,"I decided I don‚Äôt want the first 18 years of education in my life to have been a wash, so I‚Äôm reviewing/relearning all those STEM topics again. And why not? Those principles haven‚Äôt changed. 

Anywho, Brilliant teaches these topics so well and all in one package. Highly recommended!"
2021,Thanks yo Veritasium that has recommended
2021,Good logical thinking! But expensive premium one for me!
2021,Love the education from these people
2021,üëçüëçüëçüëç
2021,"Keep it up Brilliant! 

The only issue I have is the price point. I would really appreciate tiered pricing so ppl who are students and life long learners can become a long tail subscribers for your company."
2021,Best app for challenging the brain muscle! Great user interface and beautiful in its presentation. Content however is king amongst the strengths of the app! Try it and you‚Äôll be addicted.
2021,So far these are wonderful examples I am very much enjoying the basic algebra.

2021,Good
2021,Great way to refresh your brain in multiple areas. Brilliant!
2021,It is the best learning platform I‚Äôve ever seen way better than school. It helps teaches you to use  formulas and how they work. It is a great way to learn. I love Brilliant. They use examples that are fun and make it easier to learn.üëçüòé
2021,Surprisingly effective at communicating  core concepts
2021,I‚Äôm really enjoying the app. Very stimulating.
2021,really worth it.
2021,It‚Äôs been a great tool to brush up my high school math so far. One tiny piece of feedback is that the animations get stuck sometimes and I need to refresh the page or restart the app.
2021,no joke it makes learning kinda fun
2021,Brilliant makes learning fun and challenges me to think in new ways. Brilliant!
2021,Interesting
2021,Helped me learn a lot
2021,I learn a lot and I love it.

2021,I enjoy the lesson and challenges because feed my active mind.
2021,Great app
2021,Great mind bending process!
2021,"I find myself enthralled, and I can‚Äôt say I feel guilty about it unlike some of my other pastimes on the phone. 

Keep the courses coming. Thank you!"
2021,Wow
2021,"So I‚Äôm kind of dumb, but I got this at first almost exclusively for the logic course, but i did some other stuff and it‚Äôs rly good! Easy to understand even for a stupid person like me, although if you‚Äôre smart then there‚Äôs stuff that you‚Äôll probably enjoy too! (‚Ä¢ÃÄ·¥ó‚Ä¢ÃÅ)Ÿà"
2021,great for getting you quickly immersed in the interactive problem solving games.
2021,The app is great. But it is very refreshing to see how honest they are about how they run there business.  Very impressed!!
2021,What is interesting about this app? Multiple scientific subjects explained by how you understand solving them before and after you do.
2021,"I‚Äôve self educated since 7th grade, I would have died to have had this 20 yrs ago. I had to work full time since I was 14 and I‚Äôm a single dad now, this is wonderful! I‚Äôve had to countlessly go back, time and time again: Example: Studying Physics, I can see the theory in my mind, but had to figure out what kind of mathematical approach to quantify things. I self taught trig, pre-cal and cal, but didn‚Äôt know about pure mathematics. It saves so much time to have a path to build on. I‚Äôm completely stoked, and when my daughter goes to bed, the two hrs I get are highly prized times for me. So having a lesson planned out for me dames me incredible time and frustration. This app is a god send! Thank-you! You  just don‚Äôt know how much I appreciate the (chance) to learn."
2021,"Fun interactive, with an amazingly informative wiki"
2021,"This user friendly app is an excellent way to sharpen your skills while keeping your mind sharp, and it is fun!"
2021,"I love this app so much. Heading back to college very soon, this has been a game-changer and refreshed my memory for math courses. I‚Äôm not the strongest in math, but this app allows me to get mini-lessons daily."
2021,Really like this app. Great for visual learners.
2021,"I love it it allows me to think, strengthen, and exercise my Mind in different areas."
2021,The interactivity helps TONS compared to everything else
2021,"I‚Äôm learning geometry in middle school and I‚Äôm already taking high school classes so in the eighth grade I am ahead by two years, taking sophomore classes with brilliant."
2021,"Now knowing a bunch of stuff ahead of my grade, helped me A LOT. This app is magnificent, it may seem hard at first but it is very addicting once you get a hang of it"
2021,"Aesthetically Pleasing 
Easy graphics that flow good with the UX 
Great way to keep me focused and spend 10 mins exercising my Mind!!!"
2021,It is a great app to learn something everyday.
2021,"Being in my mid 40‚Äôs, was looking to stimulate more of my mental side but have been out of the game for awhile. Like most, the knowledge I have and use is strong but what I learned a long time ago and haven‚Äôt used is hit and miss. Brilliant is great from the start‚Ä¶ interactive, well thought out, and well executed.  At 15 minutes a night it easily fits into my evening routine. Also‚Ä¶ the use of email communication is nice and not burdensome - an interactive lesson on a random topic, click to open app and continue or delete email and you won‚Äôt continuously be bombarded with emails."
2021,Great app
2021,I wish it were cheaper to subscribe because I would in a heartbeat. It‚Äôs the best way to start my day and keep my mind sharp!
2021,Daiky challeges are great
2021,I love the way this app teaches.  It seems to flow easier with the way I personally process information.  I recommend anyone at least give it a shot.
2021,The app is good and runs smoothly. I revise because I graduated college six years ago. Very helpful.
2021,Great platform all around and good goal
2021,I am learning something I should have learned a long time ago
2021,Really good!
2021,Dealing only with designer magnetics.
2021,:)
2021,"I‚Äôm a computer science major and I know how to code but I had the hardest time trying to understand the logic behind my code and how to improve it. This app, though, helped me so much with that. It gave the perfect examples and explained everything perfectly. I‚Äôve already taken three courses and loved every one of them. Definitely recommend trying if your in the same situation!"
2021,I have been eyeing this app for quite some time. I‚Äôve been using it to help my studies
2021,"What makes this app amazing is the difficulty gradient. I have taken many collegiate courses and I find that formal courses often jump in difficulty. Brilliant slowly increases the difficulty of problems allowing you to gradually build upon the previous ones without having to make massive jumps in skill. Furthermore, it‚Äôs rather difficult to compile large problem sets in some of the combinatorics and logic questions."
2021,I like how this app gives me a different perspective on calculus :)
2021,"Brilliant does a great job explaining why things are the way they are. In school we were taught principles and were given rudimentary explanations for why they are true, but Brilliant helps you understand on a much deeper level. The quizzes force you to think, but do not present problems that seem impossible to solve."
2021,Much good very recommend
2021,Epic app improves sharpness of thinking
2021,Learning a lot. Hope they keep adding to it.
2021,App
2021,I‚Äôm taking the logic course and I already feel smarter
2021,"This makes brushing up on my skills to go back to college not fun, but fascinating, which is better. I just want to get my ‚Äòmaking $ with the drop outs‚Äô classes over so I can start learning statistics and computer science. Thanks for developing this better  way of learning. Time is of the essence, learn better!"
2021,"Nah I really love this app man, really teaches you efficient ways to think, on the go too. Like you can wrap up courses pretty quickly, although some are harder and will make u take more time. All fun though and the animations help. Plus if you get stumped they will show u an explanation, no guilt for asking! Learning is appreciated here. Love it."
2021,I‚Äôve tried different mind apps. Each one has been worth a try but this is more than mind games. This is mind application software üíØ
2021,"Last year I was a part of the graduating class of 2020 where I received my B.S.c in mathematics.  As you might imagine, Instead of using my skills in the workplace (or at graduate school) I have been stuck in quarantine.  Brilliant has helped me review key concepts I will need for whatever comes next by providing engaging problems, a user friendly platform, and a myriad of topics to choose from.  As someone with a mathematics background, I particularly enjoy the logical approach to not only the math course but also the physics and computer science courses they offer.  

Overall it has been a great experience (other than the cost) and I recommend it to those trying to expand their minds while they are trapped inside."
2021,I did not think that multivariate calculus and fun could be found in the same sentence but somehow Brilliant made it happen. Outstanding.
2021,The free section is very good but I would definitely pay for the premium if it wasn‚Äôt so expensive. I would recommend getting this app for the free stuff alone and pay later if you think it‚Äôs worth it
2021,It is very thoughtful provoking and gets you to discover answers.
2021,Enjoying this app!
2021,"Geared towards professionals, students, or anyone looking to learn. Foundational courses as well as advanced topics, there‚Äôs something for everyone."
2021,Brilliantly built by brilliant people.
2021,"I love this app. Elegant and simple design, great courses, and fun problems."
2021,"As individual with autism spectrum disorder and ADHD, this app approach is exuberantly helpful. It provides a systematic yet fluid approach to critical thinking in logic in a scientific context. I wish there were more apps like this‚Äîheck‚ÄîI wish I learned this way growing up as a neurodivergent individual."
2021,"I love the app, it is amazing how I can gain a better understanding of topics I already knew and at the same time learn new things I've never gotten educated about."
2021,The puzzles are fantastic. It‚Äôs a quick and easy way to make sure I‚Äôm exercising my brain on a daily basis!
2021,Excellent progression
2021,Don‚Äôt have much to say except it‚Äôs cool
2021,Perfect way for me to get a quick mental pick-me-up
2021,"It‚Äôs great!!!!!

2021,So much better than Instagram or news
2021,Loving it!
2021,"I had let my mathematics skills wane in the last few years and so happy to be working on improving. 
Definitely worth the subscription price and then some. 

Look forward to seeing how much progress I can make if I really stick to it."
2021,What a super learning site!!!  So good to exercise my grey cells :-)
2021,Good
2021,Really love it. I wish they had monthly fee because it‚Äôs a bit expensive to buy in one installment.
2021,This an excellent app. Easy to navigate and the courses aren‚Äôt super hard to learn. I would recommend this to anybody who loves to learn!
2021,It g√úd
2021,I have struggled with learning physical books but this app has really helped me out tremendously. A must have for anyone aspiring to become a mathematician!

2021,This app explains topics very well and let‚Äôs me practice them while also enjoying myself
2021,"this app is outstanding. i wish i could pause the animations,,, instead of having to wait through the whole run of it just to wrap my head around one part."
2021,Love the app!
2021,Keep your brain healthy.  Give it a good workout.  Enjoy  a Brilliant exercise every day.
2021,I love it! It makes you think and it‚Äôs fun at the same time!
2021,Very challenging! Exactly what I was looking for
2021,"5 minutes into the app I was able to understand equations that I‚Äôd been forced to memorize for the past few years. Memorizing is fine if you want to data-dump. But if you plan on pursuing anything math or STEM related, understanding it is key. So far the learning experience has been great."
2021,This was all I needed growing upüò≠üíõüíõ
2021,They really put brilliant together in a way that makes learning easy. More focus on practical application and less on memorizing every step. Which works better for me. I‚Äôm already way better at math than I was in high school and I‚Äôve only had it two days.
2021,I am very pleased with the brilliance of brilliant!!!
2021,A great platform for learning
2021,The app forces your brain to think in multiple directions instead of what you think the solution may be in front of you! Excellent!
2021,Really enjoyed being able to focus on something else on work breaks rather than scrolling Instagram (Ironically it was an instagram ad that got me hooked though!)
2021,I just love learning and being challenged. Making this part of my daily routine for 2021.

I don‚Äôt understand how an app can be better than the entire school system. Guys I promise you
If you true this app for free you will eventually end up subscribing. When you do remember this comment :! )"
2021,Very time effective app. Really great platform to learn materials quickly.
2021,i love it
2021,"Due to COVID-19, the school curriculum has been cut short and class time has been cut in half. This means I‚Äôm not learning as much. But thanks to Brilliant, I can now learn more about topics I‚Äôve never even heard of! Thanks Brilliant!"
2021,"This app is exactly what i was looking for to help me with wasting time. It is designed with a nice UI that‚Äôs easy to navigate. The diagrams and animations are great. They help make it more fun and also cement concepts into memory better. That translates into easier understanding. I was tired of all of the news, social media and other distractions in life. Brilliant has helped me waste my time wisely! Thank you!"

2021,The title says it all
2021,It‚Äôs good.
2021,"I‚Äôm very excited about the potential of this program to help my students learn in a fun way! I started by testing it on my middle schooler, and it has officially overtaken her YouTube habit."
2021,Wow make smart
2021,Just awesome!!!
2021,This app really will have you THINKING and I love it! So far so good üòÜ
2021,Don‚Äôt need to go to school just learn math from this app. Best life changer I swear on my life and I pray to God He knows.
2021,I just like this app so much because it makes learning fun
2021,The best app ever
2021,"Worth it. Lots of you tubers do specials with it and give you a 20% discount for annual membership. Like if you can afford Netflix or cable, then you can get this! Amazing!"
2021,It‚Äôs like a workout program for your brain.
2021,Thoughtful and intriguing. Fantastic learning platform for all ages
2021,I really like this app a lot
2021,Love that it makes you think
2021,Love it
2021,great app would reccomend
2021,Great to learn on here
2021,:)
2021,Awesome
2021,"This app is the teacher I‚Äôve always wanted to have in school: engaging, enlightening and it makes learning very addicting."
2021,Perfectly advertised
2021,Yes
2021,"the other apps i‚Äôve tried out only would have been helpful if i payed for their full premium version. This app has lots of different courses and subjects to explore and i did not have to pay any money to be able to access them. The only downside is that if you are not particularly good at critical thinking or thinking like a mathematician, some of these course are really hard to follow. I‚Äôm not very good at math but i want to be, so i go through the courses very slowly. I‚Äôm still very impressed at how much i can learn on here for free. I‚Äôm giving it 5 stars because i want other people to be able to easily access free education."
2021,If you have an interest it‚Äôs a good crash course
2021,"I have enjoy paid for the full version, but the bait is luring me in. 
I have tried their daily puzzle and some of the warm up quizzes.   So far they are quite unique and diverse while remaining stimulating.  
Most mind quiz apps are wrought with errors, but this one is clean.
The single largest reason I don‚Äôt go premium is the steep price tag. Half the cost would yield more than double the customers, win-win."
2021,First time using this app and it truly redefine my assumptions about mathematics.  I love the step by step and detailed explanation as to how to get the answer or solve the problem.  Truly amazing app!  The pricing is just too expensive‚Ä¶
2021,Explains things real well
2021,"Not only educational, but also fun. Love this app! üëçüòÉ"
2021,I‚Äôve been playing for only a month and I like it. I want more apps like this.
2021,"Oh this is so much fun! I can let it know where I am on the spectrum of understanding the principles, and I get stuff right outside my comfort zone. Learning a lot."
2021,üëå
2021,Hhhhj
2021,"I‚Äôm awful at math, so this helps out"
2021,"So far, I enjoy the introduction to reasoning skills. I haven‚Äôt used the app very long, but I‚Äôve experienced that  the app is engaging from the moment you start using it. There are quite a few subjects to select from, and I‚Äôve chosen to start from the beginning for a fresh outlook on mathematics. I expected daunting, simple problems to work through, and was surprised to find that while simple elements are introduced they are not boring . I‚Äôm grateful for the opportunity to enrich my perspective on the fundamentals as I‚Äôm a higher level math student feeling like I‚Äôve reached a ceiling because my mathematical background is one of ‚Äúhere are the steps, now  solve the problem‚Äù. I hope to regain a love for mathematics, and so far, it seems like I‚Äôm already there."
2021,"I like all the puzzles so far, I also appreciate the in depth explanations if you end up getting an incorrect answer. Very well done :)"
2021,Keeps the mind sharp. Exercise bike for the mind.
2021,"I love how there‚Äôs no feeling of being stupid for not understanding, everything is explained well, but not so dumbed down that it‚Äôs boring or insulting.  The curriculum is fun and I‚Äôm definitely getting to use my brain again."
2021,A must have for anyone with a curious mind.
2021,"This app helps you understand everything by helping you teach yourself as apprised to just giving you the answer, it really helps you infer information."
2021,That‚Äôs all I have to say only awesome
2021,"Brilliant is free. Yes, there IS a payed version, but the free version is just great. It makes learning math fun, something I had thought was impossible."
2021,This app helps me broaden perspectives and understanding of mathematics and science
2021,Excellent app I am really enjoying it
2021,I love the content. I love the delivery method. Iove the app. Byte sized modules with interactive problems and animations. I've found I retain what I learn here a lot more than video delivery based courses.
2021,Brilliant!
2021,I just like it
2021,"This tool is amazing for self-taught learners and students that want to enhance their critical thinking or mathematical ability, and supplement their academic course work. It‚Äôs amazing a resource like this available. The learning content is great people that designed the course work really put thought into every problem. Most problems are fun challenging and interesting. There should be more apps like this. 
^^^ This is automatically generated response of developers praising themselves and I agree it is a very well made and interesting app for anyone looking to exercise their mind and delve into interesting puzzles and problems and I agree with all the praise given by the developers to themselves in the autogenerated review but I would like for them leave some of the praising up to the user of the app. Amazing work this app is a great supplement to learning and the designers of the app are amazing."
2021,"Main reason I bought is cuz I‚Äôm struggling in diff eq and I saw the course here that has everything taught in it! So far everything is going great plus as a bonus there‚Äôs also a lot of other classes too.

One thing though. PLEASE ADD DARK MODE!!!!! MY EYES AT NIGHT AAAAAAHHHHH!!"
2021,"ali recommends this app and it doesn‚Äôt fail my expectation, love it"

I just wish I could afford the premium üòÖ But that‚Äôs the price of quality."
2021,Outstanding app.
2021,Fun app to get your brain thinking in different ways. I enjoy it and recommend it
2021,"Well worth the money.  They have amazing selection of educational material, and they make learning complicated concepts fun.  Great for your brain.  Go easy on yourself, some of the puzzles are quite difficult, but they give great explanations."
2021,Indubitably

If you‚Äôre someone like me, definitely try it out! The free trial is great, of course (‚Äòcause who doesn‚Äôt like free stuff?), but it‚Äôs still worth the money. The curriculum is awesome and the way they implement ideas and facts into visuals is very helpful for remembering.

All-in-all, I‚Äôm in love with Brilliant. Thank you guys so much!!

Also - Regarding the app itself, my one issue is that the home page isn‚Äôt loading. It‚Äôs not a big deal, but it‚Äôs still a bug that I wanted to bring to attention."
2022,Great

2022,I love brilliant my fave game app right now.
2022,So far it is fun.  Fantastic refresher.
2022,I loooooove this - creative stories and fun brain exercises
2022,Good
2022,I love brilliant it‚Äôs better than khan academy in terms of how in depth it goes like tell me what algebra is go in depth with it I don‚Äôt know if you want to learn English and all other topics go to khan if you want to learn STEM go on brilliant
2022,Accessible and easy! One request‚Äî dark mode for learning while in a dim room or before bed.
2022,YES
2022,Super useful
2022,Brilliant is good
2022,Haven‚Äôt been testing this app out for very long but so far so good.
2022,"I‚Äôm catching back up on calculus with this, I‚Äôm doing fine so far"
2022,Great way to learn!
2022,Even though I‚Äôm an accomplished professional in a technical field I‚Äôve always struggled with math. This app is helping me use my strengths (visualization and 2d/3d arts) to understand fundamental concepts I had never truly grasped.
2022,"I, like many people, think of math and science as the most intimidating subjects. ""Brilliant"" helps remove the veil of mystery which feeds that fear. Math and science are presented in great visuals and what was once mysterious to me is increasingly becoming a confident skillset. I highly recommend this app to students and adult learners alike."
2022,"It‚Äôs everything I wanted and more!! I subscribed for my son who‚Äôs in 9th grade, but I use it too!"
2022,"I love the logic course, it‚Äôs so simple yet incredibly challenging, it‚Äôs not like limos it‚Äôs where it tests you and you lose. It‚Äôs more like it tests you and then gives you feedback on how you can improve, I think this is a good mode of thinking for someone who wants to learn."
2022,Trains brains to think in new ways. Great for teens!
2022,It is a grate app to us to sharpen your learning skills.
2022,"Great app
It is making me smarter while keeping me interested and is an all around great app whether you just want to get smarter and learn concepts of math like algebra and calculus, or if you‚Äôre just looking to have fun by learning how rocket ships work."
2022,GDKGMXGIJNXIUGOLGUIHPTIURHDJIUTHGIOTRUGN

2022,Learning alot of necessary information that I never knew before
2022,Simply changed the way I think
2022,"I‚Äôm loving the opportunity to exercise my brain by reviewing physics, science, logic, and more. It is a great way to pass the time AND get smarter. The lessons do a great job walking you through progressively harder problems and more advanced concepts."
2022,.. it kills it.
2022,Love this app
2022,"I‚Äôm early in using it but so far have found it interesting and really drawing me in with its examples in logic. When I got stuck on one, the step by step instruction on how to solve the question was super helpful."
2022,"no need to go classes or unable to attend courses, this is the one."
2022,This is great!
2022,Thought me a lot but still very easy to understand and got me ahead in school.
2022,"This app is perfect!!! The layout, descriptions, illustrations and exercises are well designed. I am actually enjoying reviewing math principals. I use the app kind of like a game, making a little progress whenever I have downtime. This is so much better than just reading a book or watching YouTube videos, and it‚Äôs truly enjoyable. Thanks so much to your entire team!!"
2022,Best way to learn in the history of humankind.
2022,"Absolutely Incredible app! For a lifelong learner, it is super easy, convenient, and incredibly fun to review long forgotten or new concepts. One of the best purchases I have ever made, and hands down my favorite app. Highly recommended!"
2022,I think this is an excellent app to help your learn programming. It weeds out what you don't know so you can concentrate on the aspect of the app.
2022,SIMPLY BRILLIANT!!!  üåà‚ö°Ô∏è
2022,"It hasn't been long since I'm using Brilliant, but I can see its effects already. Wether you are in taxi, metro, bus or some other place where you just sit, wait and do nothing, pick up your phone, open Brilliant app and squeeze maximum value of your time by getting educated everywhere. It doesn't seem much at first, but when you do it consistently you'll some amazing results."
2022,"It feels like playing a video game but it focuses on learning, which is awesome.

The few gripes I have are minor - for example there are a lot more typos and mistakes than I anticipated, but I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll get ironed out as people report them; there is no dark mode and the app‚Äôs theme is white so it‚Äôs a bit too bright at night even with brightness down; lastly, if you stop mid-lesson and later resume, it makes you start from the beginning again. I understand that this is probably better so you can review where you left off, but making that a choice rather than mandatory would be great.

I‚Äôm not listing the pros of the app because they are self-evident and as advertised: it‚Äôs a fun, interactive way to learn and keep up with STEM concepts with very easy-to-follow explanations."
2022,Get dis APP ‚ö°Ô∏è
2022,Well just tried the free stuff and well it‚Äôs pretty cool do work problems with the app
2022,I love it! Learning something new every day. You need to download!

2022,Loving the app and so many subjects to learn .
2022,Really good
2022,"Overall, it‚Äôs been great. Helping me catch up on classes and I might use it to skip PreCalculus so I can take my schools AP Calc BC and Ap Statsitics since if I don‚Äôt skip PreCalc I can‚Äôt take ap stats."
2022,Fun and useful.
2022,Yes
2022,I‚Äôm currently enrolled in college & I was looking for a place online to build my knowledge of science. This is perfect!

2022,"I never got to go to college,  but I‚Äôm a big science nerd.  When I read science for fun I have a definite lack of some fundamentals.  I have been through tedious boring lecture type online courses and mostly I just fall asleep.
I feel like I‚Äôm playing games when I use Brilliant.  I know I‚Äôm actually learning stuff because I understand stand later stuff that builds on the first lessons.   I don‚Äôt know why they just don‚Äôt give every kid in school a Brilliant app and everyone have fun and learn."
2022,I need this app to exercise my mind.
2022,"No pens√© que brilliant fuera a ser para m√≠, pero el sistema de ‚Äúgamification‚Äù funciona bien. Recomendado para quienes quieran aprender habilidades relacionadas con STEM."
2022,I‚Äôm enjoying using Brilliant.
2022,Great passive learning app.
2022,It‚Äôs a great learning experience on brilliant by how engaging and interesting the courses are
2022,It‚Äôs really effective for me. I love how I can just leave the app and pick right back up where I was at later on.
2022,"I love this app so much! It helps me learn A LOT and I know so much about math, science, and computer science. The only thing I would add or change is to maybe make more things to learn like other stuff like languages? how much along with the basics but it doesn‚Äôt really help well you know language arts is because it doesn‚Äôt teach that. or other things like world culture or social studies. still amazing but I was mostly add how to learn languages or other things."
2022,"I like to exercise my brain, solve problems. It help me to be smart on my daily life"
2022,"It's easy to follow the lessons. They do a great job putting the lessons together with gifs, images, texts, and interactivity. I used to check Twitter on my bathroom break. Now I pop open brilliant and learn about math and science."

I‚Äôm have a blast 
Best regards SN"
2022,"Excellent app to keep your tractory for building mathematical & computer science fundamental by establishing atomic habits, opening this app"
2022,I don‚Äôt often rate apps but this is fantastic. The content is super engaging and I love the flow of each lesson. I highly recommend it.
2022,I‚Äôm reconnecting with my classroom experience that I had with algebra and though it‚Äôs challenging I can also say that it‚Äôs rewarding and exhilarating. I had no idea how much I had forgotten and how much I still remember.
2022,"It‚Äôs fun, wide range of topics, most intuitive I‚Äôve found"
2022,"Great content, flow and not ‚Äúin your face‚Äù like so many apps."
2022,this app has helped me excel in math class at school
2022,"I am finding out at the tender age of 43 I am special needs, and the scary thing is I‚Äôm in a fairly smart phase of my life right now as far as being a little bit conscious."
2022,Being poor at school I find this to be a great and enjoyable way to learn math and science. I would appreciate a dark mode in the future. Sometimes the bright white screen can be hard on my eyes.
2022,I love use is app and I‚Äôm get smart
2022,"All the raves for Brilliant?

Its all true! I love it because it‚Äôs STEM made easy for me learn and sharpen my mind."
2022,"i love brilliant for staying sharp outside of the classroom and pursuing topics i'm actually interested in! one of my favorite parts is the sound effects! they are cute, but they should really stop when i flip the mute switch"
2022,Great learning experience
2022,brilliant brings it!
2022,"This app has been great to me, it has allowed me a new capability to learn at a quick and efficient pace."
2022,I like. Helps with diffy q
2022,I have more fun with this for I should
2022,Great mental exercises during idle moments

2022,Best way to get the ball rolling of preparations to go back to school after a lot of years out.
2022,Balls
2022,Using this app to replace my habit of going on Instagram during my downtime. I‚Äôd much rather learn than doomscroll. The lessons are great
2022,"Makes rocket science look like child‚Äôs play, like I really believe it simplifies things to a degree where even pre school children can grasp and begin to understand"
2022,"This may be my favorite app - for my kids and for me.  There are a plethora of short lessons to choose from.  They flow well amd are easy to understand through the interactive modules - some have recommended prerequisites, which is helpful so that you don‚Äôt jump into something you‚Äôre not ready for.  The section on quantum physics actually broke it down in a way I could understand.  The logic section is great.  My favorite may be the math basics / history one, which is fascinating and starts with innovative ways the ancient mathematicians figured out complex math."
2022,‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
2022,It‚Äôs simple to grasp the concepts and I enjoy the activities that solidified my understanding of each lesson.
2022,"Fun and effective learning, great for all looking to heighten ones knowledge!"
2022,So I think this is a great app and that people who write bad reviews are not nice and don‚Äôt want people to install the app.
2022,"Scratched my mental to want to learn more, and my ability to learn more."
2022,Five stars because brilliant helped me with lot of math and science
2022,I think it encourages most people to learn by giving them the dopamine of a correct answer whilst teaching them new things like computer science or algebra so all in all this is a amazing app
2022,Love it
2022,"Educational, insightful, and inspirational.

A wholesome way to pass time on the phone.

Impressive UI/UX, well thought and very functional. Haven‚Äôt encountered a single bug yet."
2022,"I have learned a lot, thank you very much."
2022,5 stars.
2022,"This is exactly what my brain needed.  There is so much substance in each course. The ratio of pages of notes or explanation or teaching to time spent with fun, silly and challenging quizzes feels perfect.  
The way you introduce and ‚Äúexplain‚Äù [essentially] deep mathematical concepts is unlike any other app or learning program.  
Thank you for adding logics to math and computer science, because now learning is common sense. :)"
2022,"Best word to describe it, don‚Äôt give up on yourself. Sometimes to learn something we just have to take a step back and look into more accesible platforms. Brilliant is just that. Take a hard concept and brilliant can explain it. Again, don‚Äôt give up on yourself, just find the best way to learn what you want to learn and knowledge is power. üí™"
2022,Easy to learn unique ideas
2022,"Hello.  I just downloaded your app and did part of one of the courses.  I love this idea!  I‚Äôve always had a hard time understanding things like math and science, but I believe I‚Äôll start understanding thing a lot more!  I heard about this service from Mark Rober, a YouTuber that you sponsored in his latest video and I immediately downloaded this to try it.  I have only one request to make, could you please bring Dark Mode to the app?  I‚Äôm visually impaired and having Dark Mode would help me not strain as hard to read the text in your app.  I read best with white text on black and I have an extremely hard time reading black text on white.  Thank you for making this incredible app!  I can‚Äôt wait to learn and understand more in the coming days, weeks, and months!"
2022,Good
2022,Awesome app
2022,Brilliant is Brilliant at making me Brilliant
2022,I enjoyed the walk this process.
2022,Love it
2022,Phenomenal content y‚Äôall! A great supplement to those like me starting/on their coding/ tech journey
2022,"Brilliant does a great job breaking down complex problems and ideas into simpler, easy to understand ideas. As someone who took a lot of math in college, Brilliant is far better than all my professors combined."
2022,Everything good
2022,I enjoy the different ways lessons are taught.
2022,This app is the only app I have that I like.
2022,"Hello, there's a bug where when I click on ""continue"" after a question, it sometimes double clicks the button, skipping the next page of info."
2022,Very clever presentation of the various subjects.  The product has been improved over the last few years.
2022,"Goes at a good pace, simple to use and learn."
2022,I‚Äôve been using it to refresh on my calculus before I go back to school and it‚Äôs been super intuitive and fun to use!
2022,The title perfectly describes the app.
2022,It is perfect. The end!
2022,"Clever!!! 
 
I love it!"
2022,This is Brilliant!
2022,I love these courses. I hope you guys developing this app add biology and chemistry topics in the near future.
2022,.
2022,Fun
2022,"This app is allowing me to expand my brains capacity to understand natures fundamental laws from special relativity, to solving complex courses such as problem solving/ Logic. Doing very good when it comes to logic. I‚Äôm improving in mathematics. However, I‚Äôm a little lost with special relativity. It‚Äôs most likely because my curiosity got the best of me and compelled me to skip all the other essential courses to understanding it and the meaning behind certain symbols (variables). I would highly recommend using an app called Elevate in conjunction with Brilliant. They go very well together hand-in-hand, at least from my experience. I use Elevate as a pre-workout to stretch and warm up my brain before using Brilliant, as it is more advanced than Elevate. Just a suggestion. I hope this review helps!"
2022,Great app
2022,"Dabbling in a few courses, and I‚Äôm blown away by how well presented the information is, and with such a responsive design."
2022,It‚Äôs ‚Ä¶ Brilliant!
2022,This app is brilliant (no pun intended) it help me learn stuff I struggle with and makes it fun
2022,E
2022,"I got this app for my 11 year old girl and she absolutely loves it. My husband and I also enjoy it. 
I‚Äôve recommended it to friends."
2022,I love this app even for my self learning and I‚Äôm a 46 year old man I recommended a 100%!!
2022,"Thanks for creating this application. Without doubt, the tools covered here are excellent and simple. Highly recommend this to anyone."
2022,"The access you get to whatever your looking to broaden your knowledge in is impeccable. I love this app and what they stand for and their mission. Amazing customer service if you have any problems with finding something or the app itself as well, 5 stars easy."
2022,Wonderful app
2022,"This app cover every subject with simple examples that‚Äôs so easy to follow through. I know the price is more but it is worth it. Just get the time for it, I play games too much but I think this app is great!!!
Guys believe me, the app is great! Your money is well spent on here for education"
2022,Material nicely presented
2022,Great app to keep you sharp with casual learning or you can truly upgrade your knowledge with all the great courses they have üß†
2022,this is a spectacular app that makes difficult science accessible to virtually anyone
2022,This might be the best investment if you are curious.
2022,"I‚Äôve known Brilliant for over a year but kept thinking how much money I‚Äôd spend in vain if I end up not using it often. Finally decided to get an annual subscription, and it didn‚Äôt disappoint me at all. The animation is very well designed and it pretty accurately reflects the actual physics. Both website and mobile app work nicely. I only use it for my own fun and yet I now spend hours on it everyday."
2022,"The program,app,website is worth every penny look i'm 33 and i couldn't do basic 5th grade math that i remember back in grade school i would do with ease the content is friendly and useful i plan on going back to school to become
a mathematician so this app is a good workout  thank you brilliant for a good app."
2022,Always sharing the great value of your program!
2022,I had gotten rusty with math but not only am I back to where I was before but ive understood old concepts in a new better way and I‚Äôve learned a ton of new things as well. Not just math but physics as well!
2022,Educative
2022,"UI is really clean and engaging. Decent price for what you‚Äôre getting and at the very least, Brilliant, is opening new doors to explore further."
2022,It is very helpful and you actually learn quite a lot on brilliant and I just absolutely love it and sodas my little brother and sodas my whole family.
2022,"The brilliant app is just that, brilliant. This app teaches logic, reasoning, and does it while entertaining!"
2022,"I use this with my nonspeaking students and my own kids. They love it. Most importantly, the diagrams make these concepts accessible to all types of brains and learning styles"
2022,"Very well thought out, intuitive, educational and entertaining!"
2022,Pnjn
2022,This app is perfect for people of all ages and really helps you learn about topics you wouldn‚Äôt learn in school.
2022,"I have to say that I have really been enjoying the courses provided by brilliant. Great set of topics and there has been a lot of work put in to building the content. I love the structure in their teaching and it has been a better experience than I had originally expected. Keep the content coming and if you haven‚Äôt tried their trial yet, I recommend at least that if you enjoy learning!"
2022,"AHHHH MY EYES THEY BURN, the learning is fun but WHY ISNT THERE DARK MODE BRO NOW I CANT LEARN AT NIGHT."
2022,It‚Äôs brilliant
2022,Really helpful
2022,Awesome app and learning experience!
2022,Well put together
2022,:)
2022,"Makes learning so much fun. I am literally addicted! Please keep up the good work and keep adding new high quality content. I would love some modules on other disciplines like liberal arts, history, etc."
2022,"I learned how to do calculus and trig, and over my weekends I did coding and now a year after downloading I can definitely see a big boost in education."
2022,"I‚Äôm using Brilliant to learn computer science. I‚Äôve always had an interest in computer science, but always wrote it off as being too advanced and too technical for me. 

Brilliant has made learning computer science fun and approachable. The interactive material makes the learner much more engaged, which I believe is crucial for learning and critical thinking. It makes an overwhelming topic like computer science easy to understand and digest, which in turn leaves the learner wanting to do more.

If you lack confidence in your learning ability, or are tackling a difficult subject, I highly recommend Brilliant."
2022,"I enjoy re-learning math. The explanations are clear and the lessons are fun. If I had this when I was younger, I probably would‚Äôve performed better in school. Who knows? Anyway, Brilliant is a great tool for exercising my mind. I recommend this to anyone who wants to brush up on their math skills."
2022,I find this app very fun to use when I‚Äôm bored or want to learn something new. It is very informative and explains every step of a problem.
2022,Want more courses.
2022,"I had never rated or reviewed an app before.
But this is gold."
2022,"Courses are great, but don‚Äôt yet touch on all STEM subjects. Integrated learning between biology, chemistry, math, and physics can creat a far deeper and more meaningful understanding of our world, and that‚Äôs not widely available anywhere."
2022,"Brilliant is really amazing stuff. I think the desktop application is the best, but the iPhone/pad material is really good too. 

For visual and experiential learners this is really great."
2022,"If you give serious commitment to Brilliant then you will come away with a working knowledge of high level mathematics and the discipline to work problems through to the end. It‚Äôs as hard as it needs to be to cover the challenging subject matter‚Äîbut no harder. It exposed that I had a weak foundation in math and gave me the tools to fix it. Clearly, mathematics pedagogy has improved since I was in school. I feel like the advances in math instruction  are being infused into this app. The illustrations and the progress tracking are motivating to the soul and pleasing to the eye. It‚Äôs worth the money if you are serious or thinking about getting serious about math/science."
2022,Good
2022,Helps you understand complex topics
2022,"Been using for a few weeks now, has really helped me with my math! Absolutely amazing and you need to try it! It‚Äôs very intuitive, and easy to use! Thank you, Brilliant!"
2022,"I is big brain bc of app. Very good, premium worth."
2022,As somebody who genuinely loves learning about random things this app is phenomenal!
2022,The app is brilliant. I love the simplified explanations of complex subjects.
2022,"This app is so fun. Can you believe we can use visualizations‚Äîpictures and colors to learn NUMBERS? Y‚Äôall im shook. I‚Äôm a visual learner and it‚Äôs nice to feel repped in this way. I think I‚Äôm engaged. It‚Äôs weird feel an emotional attachment to an app, but I‚Äôm also loving it! üòç"
2022,I wish they will have the whole college courses to be converted into brilliant courses.
2022,Love how the app takes you through learning concepts and testing your knowledge. Better than High School math as far as I recall. Hahaha.
2022,"This app taught me so much! It changed the way I noticed things. Great, best, awesome app!"
2022,App does an excellent job of breaking down complex concepts.
2022,This is the best learning app ever!
2022,I‚Äôm on a tight budget at the moment so I‚Äôm starting to go through all the unpaid intro courses first and am looking forward to unlocking the rest in the future. I enjoy these courses more than any others I‚Äôve done so far. If brilliant had had micro biology and biology courses I would have already signed up. Hoping this will get added.
2022,Brilliant has a huge array of useful courses.
2022,"Hate to say it, but all the YouTube ads actually were right!

As someone in Highschool just interested in learning more, I got the $100 for a year subscription and its been super worth it‚Ä¶ You can learn at your own pace and they have lessons starting from basic algebra leading to applications of quantum physics and applied linear algebra. I totally recommend trying out the free trial if you think you might like this! Not to mention its actually fun!"
2022,Actually fun and educational just wish premium was a tad cheaper
2022,"Thanks brilliant, my math skills are leveling up. Instead of going back thru school, I just use the app that is the price of a textbook!"
2022,Very helpful if you want to learn new skills
2022,"Brilliant is amazing!!! I‚Äôm going into high school and advanced science and math, and I am using it to make sure I understand at least some of it, and it‚Äôs teaching me so much. I love how easy it is to understand the different classes, and the pictures and diagrams are very helpful for me. I‚Äôm a very visual person, so all of this helps me learn better. Also this isn‚Äôt just for high schoolers. There are classes for middle school to very advanced people! This is amazing I definitely recommend it! I also have premium, which is very convenient and not that expensive. I will keep using this for a while!!"
2022,I can feel myself thinking more logically and I believe has helped me in school
2022,"Excellent app, design and development is top tier and content is well worth what the premium version costs. 5 Stars From The God Emperor. 

*Note to the development team: you guys should produce and release more science, engineering, and technology based courses. For example: Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, Robotics, Rockets, Etc. üëåüèΩ"
2022,Will give 5 stars if the premium price can be reduced...
2022,I am using Brilliant to brush up on old skills and learn new ones. The format of the courses is excellent. They gradually build on basic skills to advance the student to higher levels. Lessons are extremely well constructed and make it easy to understand difficult concepts. Well done to the team at Brilliant for creating such a fantastic learning resource.
2022,It‚Äôs very engaging and stimulating.
2022,Pretty coolio instead of schoolio
2022,Much great like good learn good nicccceeee 5 star baby
2022,Brilliant is a great app of your a student or looking to learn especially for how much of the experience is free and I think anyone who want to learn more may want to pick up the app.
2022,I don‚Äôt rate apps but when I do it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs brilliant.
2022,Probably one if the best gifts I ever given to myself has been yearly subscription of Brilliant. Number theory course itself worth the money! Thanks everyone at Brilliant üôè
2022,Learning so much
2023,"Glad I found this app out.
Maybe in the future the AI function can be able to examine the studying part term of users in order to help us better learn and exercise intelligently.
This should be scientific enlightenment movement application for those underdeveloped countries! Hope there are more different languages.
I am originally from China, if there‚Äôs a chance, I hope I could work with the developers of App and innovate the way of learnings for more people in demand of knowledge like this. Especially with the logical way of thinking and tutoring."
2023,I‚Äôm a Computer Scientist and this helps keep me refreshed!
2023,"An outstanding program, even in its free program!"

2023,"Hoping for separate quizzes long-term retention, and harder courses"
2023,It‚Äôs just simply brilliant
2023,I fell smarter already
2023,"10 out of 10. If your looking to improve or revisit the fundamentals and build upon it, this is the app"
2023,A GYM for your brain
2023,Love the subjects and the bite sized chapters.
2023,All is well.
2023,This app is amazing. Great learning opportunity and many things to explore/learn about.
2023,"This app makes refreshing old material and learning new concepts fun, while easily digestible. This has been a favorite for replacing my social media habits with something far superior."
2023,bing
2023,"This app is top notch! Learning experience is almost effortless. My only complaints would be to add more topics/subjects which I‚Äôm sure will come. And the price is a little steep, probably worth it but these days moneys tight, and if I have to choose between eating and learning well, I‚Äôm going to have to sacrifice learning in order to survive."
2023,I‚Äôm loving the computational biology class. The approach makes it interesting and challenging while keeping things fun.
2023,But requires patience impossible to skip around a single subtopic‚Ä¶foils dabblers. Like myself to really have to complete something
2023,I feel Iike I am learning the concepts in the practical sense. I studied these concepts in my schooling but doing these lessons now making more sense in the real world applications.
2023,Good app
2023,Very much fun and really informative
2023,I am trying to sharpen my data science skills and the course on probability and statistics is really good. The explanations have given me a much simpler and intuitive way where earlier I used to know what to do with the formulae but now I know the intuition behind the math. Highly recommended! Will keep studying the rest of tue topics in computer science and physics and math. Thank you Brilliant! ‚ù§Ô∏èüôè
2023,"I am replacing Instagram and other media with Brilliant and YouTube learning channels and the dopamine alone has been significant, but the learning and growth will bring a massive ROI into my life."

2023,It‚Äôs awesome
2023,"Oh, I have enjoyed this app more than I thought I would."
2023,"I was so grateful and impressed at the way I was treated when I came to them about a problem. I‚Äôve been having so many health problems this past year that have affected my ability to think linearly and my cognition. I unfortunately never got to use this service/product because of everything that‚Äôs been happening; HOWEVER, when I saw a charge for brilliant.com and I had no idea what this was, I dreaded needing to reach out to the company and ask to verify my cancellation and inquire about a refund, because of the way customer service reps are usually so pushy. Luckily, when I did reach out, they gave me the link on how to do it on their website, the options they add inquiring why you‚Äôre canceling are so real and the little message they say after you process it is so affirming. I just needed to praise the way the customer service reps treat you like a person and not like a piggy bank. I‚Äôm going to try to stick to using the this now, just purely out of gratitude."
2023,This app is really good it is actually helpful in teaching and getting the concept of the subject you are interested in learning unlike other apps that barely do anything.
2023,A great way to learn for all levels.
2023,Fun
2023,very good app
2023,Way better for my mental well-being ü§ì
2023,Its a very good educational app that I seen but Premium account is expensive for us
2023,"I‚Äôve been using this app for a few days already and I honestly enjoy doing math to pass the time. My intentions was to study for my ASVAB test and just get a refresher of concepts and theories that I‚Äôve learned in highschool and college. I‚Äôm currently on their 7 day free trial and I would continue further than just that, but I‚Äôm experiencing some financial hardships. If you‚Äôre like me and you want some more places to learn or get a refresher from highschool or even prepare for SAT‚Äôs, ACT‚Äôs, and GED‚Äôs check out MARCH2SUCCESS.com"
2023,Good to keep exercising the old noggin.  Concise and clear explanations of math terms learned years ago.
2023,Like learning? It‚Äôs cool for that.
2023,Keep your mind sharp. Get this app!
2023,Sometimes in school you may miss information or not 100% understand a concept. This helps to bridge the gap!
2023,It is such an enjoyable class to learn. You can learn so much from computer science to logic. It is worth the money!
2023,"""Brilliant"" had led the way in making learning fun, and, more importantly, intuitive! I can't wait for the day when ""Brilliant"" online learning fully replaces most universities!"
2023,"This app covers topics in the manner in which I like to learn, interactively. Short lessons involving hands on visual examples (for things usually taught very abstractly like math). I do feel that the words could less ambiguous at times. But I am overall satisfied with paying for the subscription."
2023,Hope you guys can make it available in a Mac.
2023,I am enjoying going through these brief lessons.
2023,"I consider myself a well-educated person, but even though the courses rarely cover brand new material for me, the way it‚Äôs discussed often makes me think about topics in very different ways. 

I feel like I‚Äôve gained a lot of deeper understanding out of it so far,  and I‚Äôm excited to keep learning more"
2023,Good conceptualization of scientific and mathematical principles
2023,Excellent
2023,"I haven‚Äôt been using this app for that long, but it‚Äôs been good so far. Just some nice courses: science, math, etc. Give it a try."
2023,My math skills are immensely sharpened after doing a couple of these
2023,"I wanted something where I could explore a wide range of topics (from how toilets work to astrophysics) and this app does just that.  I wish there was a way to provide some specific targeted feedback on a lesson, if you see something off with the content, but overall I have very few negative things to say about the app.  I use it for my own exploration, and I have found the way it approaches concepts are helpful to assist my kids in their math journey.  Overall, great app."
2023,i‚Äôm an engineering student and this is a nice way to keep my brain busy when there‚Äôs no work left on the table
2023,I‚Äôm really enjoying working through the logic lessons. Love how interactive and clever the lessons are.
