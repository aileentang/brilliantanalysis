year,review
2016,"This app is trying to make an accessible way to learn the details of cool science stuff, but has only succeeded in giving me ptsd flashbacks to poorly written exams and quizzes specifically designed to send you back and read the chapter, except there was no chapter, it also skips huge chunks of info pivotal to the narrative but then slows down to a snails pace on the simplest, questions and worded vaguely, revise and thus could be a stimulating educational pass time"
2016,"Some of the questions on here are fun and really make you think, but they have some questions with wrong answers. I've come across a couple problems in the logic area where there's more than 1 correct answer, but they only have 1 be the right one. There is also a few errors in the solutions of them, so there still needs to be some real work done before this app can be successful."
2016,Can't tell if it is beneficial or not.
2018,Try it for a couple of months but don't sign up for the annual subscription.
2018,"Might be worthwhile if you’re only into mathematics, but if science is more enjoyable, you’ll be sorely disappointed. Most of that content seems to be in development or behind a paywall. I recommend using Kahn Academy instead since it’s truly free and has great science lessons."
2018,"It’s got great courses and all, but I kind of want to do automotive engineering and I want it to come out sooner"
2019,With the new update that came out yesterday it’s so hard to see all of the sub topics for a coarse at a glance. Now we have to scroll so far to get to other sections or just continue from the last stopping point. The old interface was much better for this.
2019,"Interesting app. I would buy service for a year, but I don’t want subscription automatically renewed.  You should be able to cancel automatic renewal in the app itself."
2019,"Many of the explanations for their problems are incomplete, and are clearly rushed through (and checked over) by people who already have a thorough understanding of the subject. This leaves the hopeful learner often stuck- wondering how to get from a->b. It’s discouraging, because the app is a great idea overall and it does eventually work. With the help of intense googling the explanations make sense in the end. However, because of this- it’s just not a finished product yet. It shouldn’t be on the market, at least for paying customers, when so much must be supplemented elsewhere due to a lack of due diligence on the part of the devs. 

The devs should focus more on testing their product to make sure it’s able to teach people and less on advertising all over the universe. Good products sell themselves. This is not yet a good product and they clearly lean into over advertising to compensate."
2019,"I subscribed to Brilliant for a month, and I’m currently on day 23, but I will not renew.
   It’s not better than free options like khan academy. And pay options like Great Courses Plus look more interesting, with lectures by the best in the field, and it’s cheaper.
  I think the graphic design of the Brilliant website and app fools some people into thinking that it’s better than it is; but, you need to look past the decoration to the content.
   A place like khan academy teaches some skills in a lecture and then tests those skills afterwards. Brilliant does it backwards: they ask you an unfamiliar question, they let you figure it out, then tell you how it works more or less afterwards.
   My problem with their teaching style is that its uneconomical both in time and money. It’s faster to watch a lecture then drill the skills afterward. If you have a difficult question on Brilliant you can waste a lot of time solving it, when it’s faster just to just be told the answer. No, this will not make you dumber, it’ll make you smarter faster, because we learn by imitating others. However, the website penalizes your stats if you do this: “you looked at the answer.” The stats are stupid too, because it just records wrong and right answers, that’s useless information. The questions I got wrong or right from just two weeks ago are irrelevant, I only care about what I need to know now. 
   Their teaching and learning philosophy is flawed. I think that you have to learn the mechanics of a skill before you can improvise."
2019,"The learning material is extremely minimal, and the app overall just feels like one giant quiz. Prerequisite knowledge is required for each section. You’re better off buying a workbook, hundreds of more questions for the same price. The app is way overpriced for the quality of product."
2019,Refreshing and interesting. The app has lots of quizzes and mind challenges to keep ones mind smart.
2019,"Why is login required? What value do I get by turning over my email address to you? Or my Google login?

The app description did not convince me that it’s worth it.  So, no thanks. I know there’s no such thing as a free lunch (or app) but, frankly, I’m tired of having to log in for so many things."
2020,"Just downloaded the app today and did the 2 daily challenges. Today is September 13th, 2020, so you can know what daily challenges I am referring to.

The first daily challenge about the ducks and the waves was perfectly fine. The second challenge, the one about having the layout of a cube and choosing the correct layout that folds up to the correct die, seemed fine but there is no indication that the question is a “Select All That Apply” type of question. 

As I said, this is my first time on this app, so as far as I knew, every question had one answer. So as you can probably guess, I got the answer wrong. But that is not the whole story. When you have a die layout, a.k.a. a “net”, you can choose the fold up the layout two different ways. Holding it in front of you, you can choose to fold it Inwards or Outwards. Nowhere in the question did it specify which way you needed to fold it up, as that changes the way the die looks. 

So I am not happy with how this daily challenge ended up, it honestly makes me want to just delete the app now. If the questions are going to continue to be this vague and unclear, then I don’t want to keep getting questions wrong due to semantics.

Other than this little qualm, Brilliant does seem to have a wide range of topics, a large community, and a lot of knowledge. My qualm is with the presentation of it all, not with the actual learning that can be achieved. So if you are here to learn, then it is a good place to be. If you are here to test your knowledge, you might want to be wary of getting things “incorrect” due to bad wording or vague instructions."
2020,"I just downloaded and begin woking on some quizzes. For some cases even if I complete the question, continue button doesn’t do anything. I have to close the app or course and come back and do same things, %50 %50 it works or not."
2020,Why not just put some ads around the content and make it all available? Then if people want to remove ads they can pay. The current cost structure is not justifiable for those of us who just want to have fun and keep a sharp mind.
2020,"This app is absolutely amazing, great for problem solving. However, over $100 a year for this app is absolutely greedy (-3 stars) a fair price would be $5/ month or $50/ year."
2020,"Everything is brilliant about Brilliant, Except the fact that you pay this much money."
2020,"This is a garbage version of khan academy that you pay for... content is mediocre, only good for book smart people."
2020,"I have purchased lifetime premium. It show error. When I contacted to customer support ,they don’t reply. I am really nervous that I lost 599dollars."
2020,"Torn on exact rating, because I do enjoy the tone of the app. However there is a glitch, I contacted support and have heard nothing. Lost out on the 7 day free trial while waiting. Which brings me to my other problem... It's outrageously expensive."
2020,"I understand that building an app is very difficult, but given how long this one has been out it still has many many frustrating bugs that make it annoying to work in.

I have quite a bit of trouble motivating myself enough to consistently use the app in my free time. But then, even when I do, little things like broken links inside of the problems, and the “Continue Course” button not continuing the course but restarting you at the beginning, and the download course feature deleting your downloaded course at the end of every month, all make for a really terrible experience. 

I pay over $100 annually to use this app, it better be a goddamn delight to use."
2020,Why not allow someone a week to decide if they are interested in signing up? A subscription with your birth date is required before you can even try the game! NO thanks.
2020,"This app has logic problems, courses on computer science, AI, etc. that are all broken down into simple, intuitive, bite sized lessons and quizzes. I enjoy continuing to learn, especially in small, manageable ways, and the content here is right up my alley. In short, I think I am THE target audience for this app. 

The problem is that I will never, EVER pay $150 for an app in one lump sum, especially not as an annual auto-renewing subscription.  I could lose interest, or the app could stop being updated and supported because they couldn’t find enough people to pay $150 for it.  I would gladly pay $12/mo. for this app, which comes to $144 annually, but a $150 lump sum for an app? It’s just not going to happen.

Developers, please add some ads or a monthly subscription option or some other payment mechanism than a $150 lump sum. I truly will miss this app after the free trial ends."
2020,"i was positive about this app but thay should ask whether you are good at learning or whether you are completely new to lessons or you know the basics.
i start learning and it was SO simple and long paragraphs that i get very bored and it took a long time to finish a short part of an specific topic.

if possible make it money require for good part of courses . 
i can’t learn anything with very simple and long articles like that.

hope you provide more advanced courses.
especially in biology."
2020,"$150/year for this is outrageously expensive. (Yes, description page says $120, but it is actually $150)

To put things in perspective — that is what you pay for A WHOLE YEAR OF NETFLIX! Compare the production costs they have to those of this app. It is ridiculous.

There is nothing here you can’t find within 1 minute on the internet, where there are tons of excellent resources available at no charge. Any high school level textbook will give you all this, or just go to the library.

App is decent, presentation mostly ok, but content is sub-par.

It is obvious which apps are developed and refined first, sold later, and which ones are sprung out of a business model and only built to try and profit from subscriptions. Cut the price to $15/year and it might be worth it, but this is simply nowhere near the level you should expect."
2020,"Em
Do e wrmeg 44&’ 

We’re"
2020,I wanted to LEARN from scratch. This seems more like a review for things you already know.
2020,"Looked like a cool app from the Today page of the App Store. Thought I would try it out for a while since it’s Free to download. Then I had to sign up to even see what content it had within the app. Then I get an ad for a 7 day free trial and then can pay $150 for a yearly subscription. There’s no options to pay monthly that I could find in the app. The daily quizzes are cool. The lessons cover a variety of math and science topics but each lesson seems shallow in content and similar to other educational apps that have been around for a while. Didn’t really hold my interest for too long, and the high subscription price is turning me away. Too bad they didn’t have a monthly subscription at an affordable price."
2020,"When you ask for comments, don’t coerce your users with two choice options. That rates a negative response in itself."
2021,"There is no way to opt out of reoccurring billing. You receive no email updating you of the upcoming charge and renewal. If you don’t go into account settings often or write the date on the calendar before it bills, you will get billed if you don’t cancel prior to that date. I wonder how much of their revenue is generated off of people forgetting and not noticing the billing cycle rolling over until it hits their account. It would be a 5 star app if not for absent option to avoid reoccurring charge."
2021,"The logic section where ordering the robots is so buggy the problems cannot be completed. Once dragging a robot cannot place back. And number of slots/spaces reduces or disappears. Very annoying! Will lose 7-day trial before this could be addressed. Very annoyed. Lost interest.

Also, why do the little audio effects have to pause whatever I’m listening to in the background? That’s incredibly annoying. 

These things are a big impediment to being s able to evaluate the efficacy of the content, and are really basic iOS UX/UI best practices. 

I won’t be subscribing now. I’ll check back in a year."
2021,"For a service about learning it expects you to already know the subject. So many quizzes are the “here’s a problem that was the magnum opus of a famous mathematician, what’s the solution? 😎👏”. You’ll get maybe one question about something important, it’ll be described in a dense, inaccessible way the next step then never built or practiced on. Or you’ll get the usual bevy of abstract ways to describe what you’re learning while expecting you to know how to convert it to algebra. No audio option, just a bunch of dense text. 

If you need to learn something, don’t spend your money on this over hyped malaise."
2021,I see price spiked significantly. With no monthly option I don’t see enough value. App seems unfinished as bottom menu today or more not working. Content is great but too pricey unfortunately
2021,This app is not actually free. You must sign up for an expensive subscription to use it.
2021,"I wanted to download brilliant because I’ve heard great things about it. However, I could not make an account. I tried to use my email to sign up, but it gave me an error message. I then used my school google account, but I didn’t work either. I didn’t have a Microsoft account, which I think is the other option, so I deleted it. I was puzzled until I learned the brilliant needs to have access to email. I figured that the reason why I couldn’t do it in my normal email was because I had iCloud mail, not email, and my school google account couldn’t receive emails cause school. Anyway please make it so you do not need an email thank you brilliant."
2021,"I have a STRONG appreciation for Brilliant's style and creativity in education: but geez, they can REALLY mess up some of the questions and answers.   
   
These mistakes are the bane of my persistence in these courses regardless (I can't learn well when I'm so frustrated) but at least they have ways to report them!   
...   
Oh wait...   
That’s only if you're using the website...(*)

Though mobile would be more convenient in theory, the lack of any way to send feedback through the app actually worsens my chances of sticking with the courses that I want to be learning from.   
Instead of being able to do something that would help with an issue, I'm not only left powerless, but the course insists that, in order to continue with the lesson, I must select ""okay"" after reading the preposterous 'explanation' for why I'm wrong and the actually-incorrect answer is the one I 'should've' chosen if I'd understood.    
It's just infuriating.  
   
(*) :   
Even so, the report system is very far from satisfactory. Some courses have a more accessible report system available than others that is accessed by a hovering button on the side of the screen (still only on the website though, mobile users are silenced...), but even that is still completely a one-way discussion.
You have no clue if they even received the report, much less if they understood your point, or just discarded it as soon as they felt that you're probably just confused, without necessarily reading the entire report.
It should be brazenly obvious that a public discussion thread tied to the specific question, so the community can discuss if there are any legitimate errors with the subject, and bring any of them to the top of the discussion for the Brilliant editors to see and pay attention to first, but for now just making any improvements at all are my wish."
2022,I honestly wish these apps would tell you if the only option is a paid plan because they now wasted my time. I’m not interested in paying for this type of service. But the place is interesting or looks like it’s worthy potentially for a customer who is interested in purchasing this type of service. But when people aren’t interested in that you should not waste the person’s time you know.
2022,"The math material is very good—well explained with good examples and questions.

The account experience is poor. I can’t change my password on the iPhone. I get the reset email and click on reset link in my account the email. That link takes me back to the app login, and not to any page for resetting the password. An endless, frustrating loop. I’ve experienced frustrations with other small points regarding account menu options. It just creates a frustrating experience outside of the course material. A degree of friction for things that should be easy and seamless."
2022,"The account settings and subscription settings through the app are buggy, will open then close and default to Home Screen."
2022,"This app has a few things here and there that you may learn if you are good at memorization, but other than that they teach you at a very low level. It is frustrating for me to click through a bunch of low level questions, that just so happen to have the answers right above them, and I would only classify myself as moderately intelligent. If you are going to make an app with such little capacity to induce learning then don’t change 120 dollars a year. If the app was free I might have had the will to muddle through all of the basic answers and learn what I could, but I’m not dropping a 120 bomb to use this kids game."
2022,The download offline button does not exsist
2022,This has definitely been a great app but I’m having issues logging in. Could you fix this please?
2022,"I have been progressing several courses on a regular basis, and then had to skip for some time ( a couple of weeks or so). When I came back, even though the top view showed the progress bars correctly, when I would click into the course all the sub courses were pristine, and I would need to figure out where exactly I stopped last time. 

That happened a couple of times already and the most frustrating thing is that even though I have a paid subscription, I submitted a bunch of bug requests regarding this problem and never heard back from them. 

I do enjoy the app, but the customer service is terrible and some small bugs make the experience bad, which does deter me from using the app and making me questioning whether I even want to continue using ( and paying for) it."
2022,"I love the idea, but there’s only 66 lessons in the app and none of them have the material I need to study for the class I’m in right now. I was thinking it was a system where I could search say “krebs cycle” and then play a game to learn it. I can’t imagine how it’s worth $149…maybe for people who just like studying for fun and don’t care much what they study?"
2022,"Going through the Algebra 1+2 courses: As far as I can tell, they are only good as a review if you’ve already learned Algebra 1 and 2. They quiz you on topics *before* explaining the concept, which doesn’t make sense to me. Then they explain the concept, whether you got the answers right or wrong. Afterwards, there is no opportunity to test whether you understand and retain concepts covered.

I don’t see how this is a helpful method for learning. 

The Mathematical Fundamentals course has some fun, if simple, brain teasers. But this is very expensive for a chintzy gaming platform.

Since I’ve already paid for a year of this mess I will continue to explore and hopefully find something worthwhile."
2022,I’ve complained about it several times now via the support section of the app.  Two updates later and still no joy.
2022,"I paid for premium this morning, and then my account immediately went to “can’t verify transaction” except the funds were already taken from my bank account. Clearly the transaction happened. Once I can actually use my account I’ll review whether or not the product made the hassle worth it."
2022,…
2022,"Brilliant is a great service but the app is lacking. Cannot get to lessons in courses often and it does not track stats well, need to login to browser to see all stats."
2022,"I’ve loved this app for years, and I bought premium for a month so I could do some of the full courses since so many of them seem interesting to me. But when I use the mobile version, none of the images load. Most of the quiz questions depend on some graph or picture, but since I can’t see them I usually just have to guess the answer. It’s really annoying. These images do show up on my laptop but I always do Brilliant lessons on my phone as a “I have 10 minutes free right now” type of thing. I don’t want to have to use my laptop every time I want to do a lesson. Please fix this ASAP. My premium month is almost up and this has made the experience significantly less convenient."
2022,"i am canceling my subscription and deleting the app. i can’t deal with all the bugs on ios, offline downloads dont work, support doesnt reply, i can’t even click menu items in the app. definitely not worth $120 and most definitely a lazy app build."
2022,"It is a good app but it subscription plan is tricky. ""Monthly"" plan is actually an annual plan and there is no way switch back to monthly."
2022,"Recently my eyes have become very sensitive to bright lights, which include bright screens.  I become more fatigued when looking at white backgrounds with black text when compared to black backgrounds with white text.

I'm only giving this a 2 star rating in hopes that the developer will see it and maybe reply with either we're working on it or the less desired, it's not in our plans.  If dark mode is in the works and it arrives at some point in the future, I would give it 5 stars.  Love the ease of using my phone for brilliant, but need dark mode to lessen the eye fatigue."
2022,"All the courses I downloaded won’t load despite being downloaded to my phone & I just payed for my yearly subscription, I am really disappointed working on courses offline was the selling point."
2023,I like the concept but it does not explain the problems thoroughly and it makes the experience bad
2023,Companies that require you to bill annually probably don’t have the most confidence in their product. No thanks…
